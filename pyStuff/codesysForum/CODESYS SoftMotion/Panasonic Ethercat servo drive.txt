HiI am trying to run a servo motor using panasonic servo drive model MADHT1505B21 using mc_power softmotion function block.I cant correctly add axis variable in the mc_power. Do I need to add another device under the servo drive in device tree?

Hi,please add the DS402 generic driver if this drive is Ds402 compliant.If you are not really sure please send me a link to the esi file to check.BREdwin

Edwin,Thanks for your reply.It didnt show option to add CiA402 axis. How to add DS402 generic driver?Refer attach file for esi file for the servo drive.

Hi,this is a bug, should work.Will be solved with 3.5SP7Patch3 (End of October release...)BREdwin
