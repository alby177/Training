Hi everyone 

I have one problem using KEB drive and PLC(Combicontrol C5). For this I have written a program in CoDeSys (CFC). Program include MC_Power() and  MC_ MoveVelocity()  function blocks for single axis.

Communication between Drive & C5 is KEB HSP5/485. 

PLC configuration is as


*PLC configuration
             * KEB_HSP5interface
                         *Axis Group[VAR]
                                    *Drive[VAR] 

In program there is no error.

But it not function. Please give solution ..

Thanks & Regards,
Prabhakar Nigam
