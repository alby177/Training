Hi.Anybody knows how could configure I a drive via Codesys.I can see the parameters via coe online and I have the startup parameters, but there exist the posibility of change parameters in online mode (As coe online allows to see the parameters  iD like to change its).Thanks

Hi,I would use:SMC3_ETC_WriteParameter_CoEBREdwin

Thanks Edwin.In any case, is ig planning to change the drives parameterization via coe online?Thanks
