Hi,check if the servo supports the following operating modes which are defined in the CANopen drive profile DS402:either7 Interpolated position mode or8 Cyclic sync position modeshould be supported by your new servo drive,if yes contact 3S for a driver interface offer.cuEdwin

Hi,Ask the manufacturer for a matching PLCopen library. I'm sure, every supplier has.Regards,Rolf
