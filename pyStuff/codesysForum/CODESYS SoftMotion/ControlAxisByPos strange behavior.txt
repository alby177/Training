Hi.I have a CNC program with an virtual axis with the dynamic limits Vel= 1000, Acc and Dec=10000.When I call the function block ControlAxisByPos I notice that small position Changes are applied without the set fGapVelocity, fGapAcceleration and fGapAcceleration resuting in very rough behavior. As soon as the position step is big enough, > about 1 mm then the set acc and dec is applied. I have tried both with and without bAvoidGaps. Please see the atttached trace when I use very low fGapAcceleration and fGapAcceleration (2 mm/s2).Has anyone else noticed the same behavior and knows what to do about it?Hopful for help.Best regardsAnders

HiWhere is the atttached trace.

This issue has been resolved (wrong settings in Dynamic limits).
