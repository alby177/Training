Did you ever find a solution to the ETC_CO_sdoWrite problem?I have the same issue. I can read Sdo's fine, but can't write anything.I have downloaded and using the Ethercat example from CodeSys Store.Have tried to write with ETC_CO_sdoWrite and ETC_CO_sdoWrite4, but no luck.With ETC_CO_sdoWrite, I get the error:ETC_CO_FIRST_ERROR,SdoAbort: 16#06090031, if using WORD, and 16#06070010 with DWORD as write value.I can't find any description about the error, or errocode.!!! Update:It turned out the values I am writing are not within legal range.So problem solved.
