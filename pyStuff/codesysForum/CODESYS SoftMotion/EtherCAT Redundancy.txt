Dear sir:I was use Codesys SP8 & control RTE 32bit for test EtherCAT redundancy function,and use two LAN port connection with two station WAGO EtherCAT IO device for a redundancy ring network application, but i meet some doubt test results , and need your help check it is right.Below is mu test results:* The Ethernet cable broken with first LAN port between PC and first station EtherCAT IO device, Then EtherCAT packet based on the second LAN port to keep connection normal operation with two station EtherCAT io device.  * But when i was fix Ethernet cable connection with first LAN port between PC and first station EtherCAT IO device, The soft PLC control RTE keep working ,EtherCAT field bus be come disconnection and all EtherCAT IO device stop work.It is right test result function ? i am really consider the test result is not right way compare with 3rd PROFINET MRP function,please help me to clear confuse , thank a lot !BR,Peter

Hi Peter,which NIC's are installed on your RTE?CmpRTL81x9Mpd,CmpRTL8169Mpd,CmpEt1000Drv,CmpEt1000Drv for both`network interfaces the same type?BREdwinPS: I have tested this meanwhile with two CmpEt1000Drv Interfaces, it works but we need to set 'AutoRestart Slaves'

Dear Edwin:Thanks for your help , i already done my project when i enable 'AutoRestart Slave,I was use CmpEt1000Drv driver for two same inteli210 interface.Below is more think question:1.) When I re-open project , i find second port "network name" become same first port network name and keep original different MAC address in the two port, it is right way ? (see attached file) 2.) How many time for recover communication ? what definition?Thank again!br,Peter

Hi Peter,-I have no definition what I see is it does the Switch <x00ms- this change on the project reopen I do not see in my Project but let me check again.BREdwin
