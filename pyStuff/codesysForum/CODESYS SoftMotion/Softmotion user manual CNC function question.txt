Hello:I have a question when read softmotion user manual,As red words,it means CNC function can do 9D motion control???or just means 9 Axes motion control???And could You kindly explain me more about 2nd sentense start from whereby only two di..?Basically up to 9-dimensional motions can be realized, whereby only two dimensions are not interpolated linearly.

It can do 7D in the meaning that all axes will move according the interpolation.or simpler, when the main is moving one percent the other 6 are also moving one percent to their goal.2 axes can not be interpolated, for example spindlespeed and cooling,
