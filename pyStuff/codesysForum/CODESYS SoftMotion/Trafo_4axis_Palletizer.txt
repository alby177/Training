Dear All,Right now I am trying to build an arm using 4 axis palletizer. the problem is when I just make a simple cnc (g92 x0 y0 z0 c0) the error mention T4AP_Result_OutofWorkingSpace. For the sequence of the tranformation I used CNC->SMCI->Trafo_4axis_Palletizer. And for the SMC_TrafoConfig_4AxisPalletizer I defined at var block like this : smc_4axis_detail : SMC_TrafoConfig_4AxisPalletizer := (d1:=-100,d5:=-200,a1:=50,a2:=750,a3:=500,a4:=50);. I already have try to change the value of d_i to positive but the result still the same. Do you have any enlightment for these newbie ? It will be much better if anyone have simple example of 4 axis palletizer.Thanks before Regard,Super Newbie NB :  I add my rough drawing of my robot joint and arm. Hope it will help.

Finally found the answer. We must provide the CNC coordinate correctly. And the next problem is, the output of the Trafo_4Axis_palletizer are in degrees. How do we can handle with this ? I mean what should we do after we know the degrees ? Is there any additional function block to convert it become usable to the Axis ? And why the output of the dQ0 and dQ3 is the same ? the cnc is a simple one :N000 G92 x-500 y0 z0N010 G01 X500 Y100 z100 F100 E500 E-500Thanks for your kind attention.
