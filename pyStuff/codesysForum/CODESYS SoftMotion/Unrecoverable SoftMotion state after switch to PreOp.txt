Running v3.5.3.30 in our iX TxB SoftMotion terminals.In order to execute a special function in our servo drives, we need to leave Operational mode and go to PreOperational mode. I do this the usual way (using a pointer to the slave):pSlave^.SetOpMode(ETC_SLAVE_STATE.ETC_SLAVE_PREOPERATIONAL);The slave wState goes to PreOp and the SoftMotion axis wCommunicationState becomes 1100 (ETC device is no longer in mode Operational). So far it seeems ok.I carry out my special function by doing a couple of SDO parameter read/writes, when I'm done I go back to Operational state using a sequence where I command the drive to Init, then PreOp, then SafeOp, then Op and the drive wState becomes ETC_SLAVE_OPERATIONAL, so far so good.But.... the SoftMotion axis is still stuck in wCommunicationState 1100 no matter what I do.Neither MC_Reset or SMC3_ReinitDrive helps.In pure desperation, I even tried doing a softreset of the EtherCAT_Master using:g_pFirstMaster^.xRestart:=TRUE;g_pFirstMaster^();g_pFirstMaster^.xRestart:=FALSE;Didn't help either, for sure the EtherCat restarts but the Softmotion axis is still stuck in 1100 and MC_Reset/SMC3_ReInitDrive still doesn't help.The only thing that fixes this is a warm/cold start, which ofc isn't acceptable.I hope I'm doing it wrong... Should I switch state in another way?What to do in order to obtain a correct behaviour?Regards,Kim HansenBeijer Electronics Automation AB

Hi Kim,I've send you an email accoring this.BREdwin

Update:This seems to be working in v3.5.6.10 so most probably no longer an issue.
