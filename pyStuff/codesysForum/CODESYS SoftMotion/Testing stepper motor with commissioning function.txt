Hi,I am trying to online jog (using commissioning via online config mode) a stepper motor with Beckhoff Stepper Terminal EL7031 but i got a FB error which not able to reset (refer image1).You can see there is no configuration error in the status at image2 and 3.Can I know how to reset the FB error?

Hi,which version are you using?Is that V3.5.7.x?BREdwin

Hi Edwin,Same issue in V3.5.7.1 and V3.5.7.2 , I also tried V3.5.6.2 ( diff FB error but i didn't print screen for that ) also failed to jog the stepper motor.Thank you.

Hi Edwin Is latest codesys v3. 5.8 patch 2 able to support beckhoff el7031?

Hi,not by a easy to use SoftMotion driver, only by using this trick:"c:\Program Files (x86)\3S CODESYS\CODESYS\Projects\SoftMotion\Examples\Tutorial\PosControl.project" using velocity and act positions as feedback.Not nice but maybe this helps someone.BREdwin

Hi,Do you mean using EL4031 analog output to drive the motor and EL5101 as encoder feedback to instead of using EL7031?

Hi,no, use velocity of your EL7031 and the feedback of this device and control it by SM_Drive_PosControl.BREdwin
