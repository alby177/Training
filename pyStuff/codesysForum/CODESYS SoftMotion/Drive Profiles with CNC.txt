Are the CNC libraries compatible with the CiA402 profile (aka DS402)?  I understand that I can perform basic SoftMotion using the single axis PLCOpen motion function blocks on a network like EtherCAT via the DS402 profile, but can I also use CNC motion blocks on DS402?  Or is there some reason why the DS402 cannot be used with CNC?Also, is a CNC axis defined using the same AXIS_REF_SM3, or is it a different kind of datatype altogether.  If it is different, is a CNC axis an extension of AXIS_REF_SM3?Thank you for your help.

Hello ctdtm,DS402 is a standard where you can find more different "mode of operation", like CSP, CSV, CST, PV, PP, Interpolation, HOMING and so on.When you try to realize a CNC, you want to realize a system, not the single axis. So, in a CNC system you can use more axes, with AXIS_REF_SM3 structure, and command their by CSP, I think.In other words, yuo have to interpolate different profile with smc_interpolator, then you assign at your axes a position profile (cyclic synchronous).I hope this information help you.Regards!conoscenza
