hello

 I am using CNC editor for the motion (x,y & Z co-ordinates). Just after SMC_Interpolator i am using "SMC_TRAFO_Gantry3". Now i want 
get control on the anuglar motion of the spindle. I want to ask two questions

1. what word should i use for angular movement like we use "X" word for X-axis movement , "Y" word for Y-axis movement and so on.
2. what block should i use after "SMC_Interpolator" , so that i can control my angular movement as well

thankx
Best regards
Tahir

1.
you can take
one of add axis commands:

N2 G1 X0.01 Y0.01 Z0.01 P360 Q180 U120 V90 W60 F10 E10 E-10     

for example the letter P for the "P360Â°" then use the 
2.
SMC_ControlAxisbyPos Fb and give as position input Interpolator.piSetPosition.dA1
