When we are troubleshooting EtherCAT networks due to noise/faulty installations, we usually end up studying the working counter of the AWRM command in the returning EtherCAT datagrams.I assume the EtherCAT driver makes use of this as well. Is it possible to access this little piece of information somehow? It would save us quite some time if we could monitor it without the need of capturing the traffic and analyze it with WireShark Kim HansenBeijer Electronics Automation
