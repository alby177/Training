i hav been run my machine by using "FUNCTION BLOCKS" (i.e Moveabsolute, Move relative...... ).  

Now i am moving towards a step forward. I have managed to run my machine ( x & y direction )using CNC editor.  But by using CNC editor there is kind of very bad vibration in my machine which were not the case when i was using Fuction blocks.  

What should i do to stop this vibration???
