Hi,I am currently working with a PLC-Open implementation that does not support hardware limit-switches in the Target.Is there anyway that I can map/update the limit-switch structure in user application-space?Paramenter #1206 AXIS_REF.bHWLimitEnable must ofcourse be true, but where and how it the pointer-mapping and/or update for these inputs done?I need this on a modulo-configered axis, which is actually a linear axis, but needs modulo-positioning due to absolute position excceding 2^31 increments which is not handled correctly in PLC-Open Softmotion.Right now I have my own handling implemented, but I would like to also pass limit-switches to the Softmotion-library to have 'belt & suspenders' solution.Regards  Nicolai Hanssing

Soem investigation shows these FB might be relevant:SMC_HardwareEndSwitches(	bLow:= , 	bHigh:= , 	Axis:= , 	bOutOfArea=> );SMC_HardwareEndSwitches_Config(	bLow:= , 	bHigh:= , 	Axis:= , 	bOutOfArea=> );From the text-description it is not clear exactly how this could be used, but I suppose it would normally reside in the Drive-cycle Execute_Start-call handled by the driver-lib.But which to use, and how to use it in user-space?Nicolai Hanssing
