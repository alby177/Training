Hello,Codesys return an error with SM3_Basic library, and I don't understand what is the issue. Does someone have an idea ?Thanks in advance.Attachment:codesys.jpg

Hi,could you update to current Version?Version: 4.2.1.1 is available here:You could update by PackageManager (search for updates - prefered) or download and install https://store.codesys.com/codesys-softmotion-sl.html BREdwin

Hello,I've updated the SoftMotion package to last version (under Codesys 3.5 Sp9 patch 2): Same issue.I've also tried to open the program into Codesys 3.5 Sp10 patch 4, everything updated to last versions, and I receive a new message during compilation    :Attachment:codesys.jpg

Hi,please start SoftMotion WinV3 plc.. scan this plc and log into this 'real' plc, then it will work.BREdwin

Ok, I've tried to start the "real PLC" but it doesn't want to... and the gateway systray icon stay "black" even if Codesys put it in green when I scan devices. So I'm unable to log into. Maybe I'm missing a step !Whatever, does it mean that I can't simulate the program anymore ? It was working until ... I don't know what.
