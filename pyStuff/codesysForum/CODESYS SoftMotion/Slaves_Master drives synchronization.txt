Hello,I have an application with two slaves drives (Ethercat Beckhoff EL7041) synchronized via MC_CamIn to a virtual master drive running in Time_Position_Profile.I'm making some test under Codesys Control Win (not RTE for the moment).The problem is that when the master as finished his position profile (stopped at his final position) , the slaves are still running slowly to their final position, like they were in late, not perfectly synchronized.  Should it be a problem due to Control Win instead of RTE, or some settings into the regulation loop ?Thanks in advance.Cedric

Hi,hm...hard to say, how do you use th drive, there is no SoftMotion driver available.What about moven by simple MC_MoveAbs.. does this work?BREdwin

Hi,I'm using the drives as in the PosControl example project, sending velocity to the drives and actual positions as feedback.I'm going to try a simple MC_MoveAbsolute command I see how does it work, I'll tell you.Thanks
