Hi,I'm trying to manage a Beckhoff AX5101 drive with the AX5805 safety module and the EL6900 safety PLC from CoDeSys.Has anyone already built a similar network? Are there any sample projects to download?When I try to import the ESI Beckhoff ELx9xx.xml file, 2 errors are reported with code #22 concerning the AX5805 module, how can I resolve these errors?I'm using CoSeSys V3.5 SP11 Patch 4.Thanks for any suggestions.

Hi,could you attach the ESI file which you try, could not find the AX5805.There will coming up a new release 4.0.3.0 (this month) hope this will solve it.BREdwin

Hi,this file has been extracted from the available device folders created by TwinCAT3.I also tried with a version dated 2013 but the installation ends with the same error # 22.BRMarco

Hi Edwin,have you checked the problem I reported?With the current library there are workarounds that allow me to continue with some preliminary tests of the network and safety functions?BRMarco

Hi Marco,in current Version this is still a problem yes but (3.5SP12Patch1)I see that this will be solved with the 3.5SP13 Version(June).BREdwin

Hi,ups... I did another test with new upcoming safety EL6900 release, and this still does not work.. even with SP13 andand upcoming 4.0.3.0 EL6900 Release.Let me check to when this is planned/scheduled to fix.BREdwin

Hi Edwin,are there news about the problem I reported?Can I follow it in the Codesys bug tracker?BRMarco

Hi Marco,I see 3 points related to that:CDS-58773SCDS-1612SCDS-1310 not sure if this forum is the right place for this..BREdwin
