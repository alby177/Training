What is it for?A SoftMotion drive driver is needed to run a servo device together with CoDeSys SoftMotion. Although many devices are based on a communication standard (like CiA DSP-402) it is a fact that there are still a lot of specific behaviours of each device, that are not covered by the standard or differently interpreted by the device manufacturers. To guarantee its functionality, this driver is needed.What does it consist of?It consists of a library (that includes the application code that interface between the process data of the drive device and the SoftMotion function blocks in the application), a device description (that enables the user to add the device in the CoDeSys applicationâ€™s device tree) and a short documentation about which features of the SoftMotion Drive Interface (like position limit switches, touch probing, handling of mechanical break) are supported.Who generates this driver?The drivers are generated by 3S as a paid service. Depending on the complexity and degree of standardization of the drive, the effort of generating the driver is about 5 days of engineering, that has to be carried by the customer. The following efforts for maintaining this driver are carried by 3S.How is it delivered?After the driver has passed the autotest procedure (a testproject that includes > 50 test cases), it is delivered as a preview version to the customer together with the test protocol. Then, it is integrated into the next SP of CoDeSys and becomes part of the standard delivery package of CoDeSys. Hence, it is installed with every CoDeSys installation and is available to all CoDeSys customers. Moreover, it is added to the list of supported drives on the 3S homepage and the datasheets.What does the customer need to provide?First, the customer should provide a detailed description of the device (documentation, esp. object documentation and eds/eni files) that enables 3S to estimate the development costs. 3S will generate a commercial offer and technical specification in response.After ordering, the customer needs to supply 3S with a functioning device (controller+motor) and an in-house contact that can be asked, when questions and problems arise during implementation. The test device should stay at 3S to enable a bug fixing and testing for future versions.How long does the implementation process take?The time 3S needs for the development depends on the current work-load. Typically, it is about 2 months after delivery of the test device, but can be more.

Is there a generic driver that covers all functionality specified in the CiA DSP-402 standard?  Understanding not all functionality of the SoftMotion library will be provided but most Single-Axis function blocks should work if you provide a generic driver the following information:ControlWord, TargetPosition TargetVelocity StatusWord ActualPosition ActualVelocity  If you can please provide the information specified in JIRA CDS-25896 SM: new generic driver for DSP402 as I do not have access.

_________________The Original SoMachine Ninja

CDS-25896 : As the standardization according to DSP402 is more and more rigid, 3S generate a universal driver for all DSP402-drives with limited functionality and without guarantee that both driver and drive cooperate.

Can you provide some documentation on how to use the generic driver?

_________________The Original SoMachine Ninja

not available:but few snippets:The user can choose from a device which supports the above standard, by executing the command Project-> Add SoftMotion-DSP402-axis to attach the SoftMotion axis.The handling of the DSP402 axis is then similar to each other SoftMotion sevice.Execute the PLCopen fb's on this axis etc..

Hi,meanwhile this new feature (generic DS402 driver for SofMotion) is released with the version 3.5SP1 and you'll find the documentation in the online help.Edwin

Edwin,I downloaded the latest CoDeSys V3.5SP1HF1 and it does not have the SoftMotion help in the main online help.  If I open the "core_SoftMotion.chm" file located in the folder "C:\Program Files\3S CoDeSys\CoDeSys\Online Help\en" it still has no reference to (generic DS402 driver for SofMotion).   Can you please tell me where the online help for  (generic DS402 driver for SofMotion) is located?ThanksJzhvymetal

Hi,seems that documentation part was not released to 3.5SP1,the function for sure is released.Please check the screenshot, how to add a device (DSP402)Part of the documentationThe driver of CiA DSP402 standard can be used to connect a CiA DSP402 supported drive, to operate with CoDeSys SoftMotion, driving without a specific driver.The user can choose from a device which supports the above standard, by executing the command Project-> SoftMotion DSP402-axis-axis motion to attach a soft insert in the unit. (Rightclick in the devicetree Add Softmotion-DSP402-axis - see screenshot)

Edwin,Something is wrong with the screenshot it.  It does not show in the forum.  I can not find how to add a generic DSP402 axis.  See attached screenshot.jzhvymetal

_________________The Original SoMachine Ninja

seems that with my accessrights seems it is not to be possible to add screenshots!please install first an EDS file in your repository (a drive with DS402 capabilities)then add this new installed device to the CANopenManager (below)then rightclick on the Device -> you get a new command which gives this new featureEdwin

Can the Soft motion library be used with another PLCopen system on the same controller?I.e. Soft motion supports a select group of devices, but not one particular device.The OEM of that device supplies their own PLCopen library, would it be possible for the 2 to 'talk' to each other?

hi,they can co exist in the same project,both control their connected drives.cuEdwin

But can they operate together with the Multi Axis features of PLCopen?

Hi,i guess this will not work!Edwin
