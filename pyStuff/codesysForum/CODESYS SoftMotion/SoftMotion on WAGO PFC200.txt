Hi everyone,I am trying to use a PFC200 controller to operate a Trinamic stepper driver module using Softmotion.For Codesys Control for Windows (RTE & Win) there is a seperate device for Softmotion but for the PFC200, I'm unable to find something equivalent.Is it even possible to use this controller for Softmotion? Am I missing something important?Thanks in advance for your help!
