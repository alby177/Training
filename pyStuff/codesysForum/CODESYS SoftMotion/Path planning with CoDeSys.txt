Is there any function block for path planning in CoDeSys software.

Thanks.

what should this function block do ?

This function block has to calculate trajectory between 2 points in 2D or 3D :position and then indirect speed and acceleration.

Thers the Multi-Axis CNC profiler, wich as far as I know uses G-Code.

Sadly there's not a simple MoveAbs2D()-FB nor a MoveAbs3D()-FB wich is really annoying. You could make one yourself building upon the single-axis MoveAbs, but you will not have real synchronous movement.

I need real synchronous movement (In Sercos Cycle)

Then use either Cambox or CNC-profiler.

hi guyz........i was using the Function blocks for x,y and z motions but i have to make many motions. Right now, for every motion i am using individual function block which is very annoying  . 

Is there another way to define these motions( X,Y & Z) in function blocks?
