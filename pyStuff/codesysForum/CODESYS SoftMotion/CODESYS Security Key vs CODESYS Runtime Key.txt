What is the difference between CODESYS Security Key and CODESYS Runtime Key?Can I use CODESYS Runtime key dongle  for licencing CODESYS Control RTE SL  or CODESYS Control SoftMotion RTE SL?Best RegardsJovan Mirilovic

Hi,runtime key has additional the feature to decrypt the bootapplication.Sure should be used for Control RTE, SoftMotion RTE , Control Win.but even does work with Raspberry PI and Beaglebone to have a portable license.BREdwin
