I am sucessfull in running machine by using CNC editor. 
But i just want to ask you that how can we again empty the machine buffer for next CNC program.

After going in online mode, i make some movement by my machine. But when i do "log out" and make some changes in CNC editor (ie X,Y & Z cordinates) my machine does not understand new cordinate and it runs on the previous coordinates. But when i completely shut down my machine and switched it back on than it understand my new coordinate data. This could because of the prevous data does't delete.

Probability i have delivered my problem very clearly. If anyone knows how to solve it than please let me know .

Thankx

Best Regards
Tahir
