I know that its possible to implement an analog axis for softmotion using encoder-feedback, and analog setpoint running over an industrial bus.This however gives a terrible response due to the latency of feedback to setpoint, so I am wondering if anyone know of a module that closes the loop in a single IO-node?Ie. it does the P/I/D/V_FF position-loop calculation for a standard +/-10V with encoderfeedback, and is mappable as for instance a Cia402 or Ethercat-axis in CoDeSys.It seems an obvious product, that would allow softmotion to be used with large drives, hydraulics, stepper-drives, retrofitting to older machines etc.Its essentially implmented in every-drive for softmotion out there, except as a standalone part....So there is a market for this, I just cant find any relevant products.Anyone know of such a product?Regards  NicolaiPS: Looked at this a long time ago http://forum.codesys.com/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=1648
