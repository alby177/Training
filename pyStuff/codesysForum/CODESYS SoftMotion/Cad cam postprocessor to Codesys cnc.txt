A customer designs profiles in AutoCad using a cam plugin. Once finished, they need to generate nc code that Codesys supports, however it seems they can't find a fitting postprocessor that outputs fully compatible code as Codesys supports PARTS of the standard Maybe you could give some suggestions or product/company names as I'm sure you've come across this before?Kim HansenBeijer Electronics Automation AB

Hi Kim,which standard do you mean, this is exactly the problem.My experiance is that every cnc manufacturer has his own dialect / extensions beside the main commands in g code.You have two choises.1. customized preprocessor - Output CODESYS G-CODE2. FB in IEC which converts the dialect in CODESYS g-code while reading and processing itBREdwin

The customer is looking for a customized pre/postprocessor.But I guess we can make one ourselves as long as we get a dialect output close enough./Kim
