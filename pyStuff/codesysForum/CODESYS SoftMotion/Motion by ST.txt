Is there any demo program handling motion by ST? It seems too simpel, to mention it. 

But to hack around and try and get errors is not my way ...

Herbert

please look at the examples:
"c:\your install path\3S Software\CoDeSys V2.3\Projects\Motion\4examples\.."  for example... parts of that are in st,
hope this helps..
