Hello,I have difficulities with combining G-Code and M-code.For example:M127  M104 S205 T0 ; set temperatureG1 X0 Y0 Z5 F1000 ; lift nozzle <- the machine immidiately jumps to the set speed without any acceleration (the machine makes a jerk)G21 ; set units to millimetersG90 ; use absolute coordinatesThe following code works smoothly:G1 X0 Y0 Z5 F1000 ; lift nozzle <- the code is the sameM127  M104 S205 T0 ; set temperatureFor some reason, if the G-Code starts with an M-command, the first next G-command causes a jerk on the machine.If we remove the M-command from the beginning, the code causes no jerks on the machine.What command should I use with SoftMotion, so we can avoid the problem?
