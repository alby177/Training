Recently a library for Nanotec PD4-C has been issued with sp10 but the drive does not work well while in constant speed.While the drive is accelerating or decelerating all seems fine, but while it reaches constant speed during movement it apears like it would have a short brake(bump) every second or so during movement (maybe the position is not exact as it should be and codesys tries to correct it so the motor behaves like that – I think so bacause when I use open loop it is rotating fine without this symptom – but I need closed loop).Also after finished homing the mode in the drive changes to 8 but it still shows homing on the MC_HOME and it needs reinit for further operation.Drive is connected to a can network, changing sync time does not resolve the issue. (tested using licensed softmotion CNC PLC).Any clues how to resolve it.PS. Other drive types connected to the same PLC work fine (also while in synchonized movement with PD4-C).
