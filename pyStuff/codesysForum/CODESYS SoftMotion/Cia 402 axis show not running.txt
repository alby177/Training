Hi,I am using codesys softmotion to run a servo motor with delta asda a2e ethercat servo drive.The cia 402 axis will show not running if I start the motor without turn on online config mode . I have to turn on online config mode once before download the program. If not the servo motor will not able to run.Thanks.

Hi,Are you working on a PC? PLC?Does the Codesys tell you that he need to download software when turning on Online Mode?in this case, waybe the boot program was not sent to your PLC.If it is a PC, maybe you need the Internal runtime to be started... I heard the 'free' one was running only 1hour.Williams

How did you add a CIA 402 axis for Delta A2E - I have added the drive but there is no option for adding an axis???

Hi,which CODESYS Version are you using?<3.5SP8?BREdwin

Version 3.5.7.1I have installed the drive once again as administrator and now I can add CIA drive...But now I have a SYNC signal error from the drive when trying to Power On (drive is in state - operational)...
