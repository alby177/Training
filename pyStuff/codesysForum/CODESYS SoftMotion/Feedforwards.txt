Dears.I am working with Lenze I700 drives in sync position mode. Codesys sends the speed feedforward in encoderPulses/s and i700 interprets it as rpm factorized in 480000/2^32. That causes an following error proportional at speed. There exist any parameter to solve that?Thanks

Hi Josep M. RamsHave you found a solution I have the same problem with following error.Thanks

Hi.Modifying fFactorvel in ref_axe it works (But not seems to be a elegant method   ), but I cannot know how to set the addTorque FF.

Thank you for info about your solution.
