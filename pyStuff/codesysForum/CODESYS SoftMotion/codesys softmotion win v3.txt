HelloI am trying to control serad servo via codesys softmotion win v3. But i dont know where to start.Which softplc i should download and where. is there any manual for codesys softmotion win v3

Hi,in general for SoftMotion you need a realtime capable plc - for example:SoftMotion RTE:http://store.codesys.com/systeme/codesy ... te-sl.html (this is the plc which you install on the target pc - see the documentation what is needed to set to have hard realtime)Which fieldbus does the 'serad servo' support?Here are some SoftMotion Projects/tutorial:c:\Program Files (x86)\3S CODESYS\CODESYS\Projects\SoftMotion\4.1.1.0\Examples\Tutorial\Which is a good startpoint + onlinehelp.BREdwin
