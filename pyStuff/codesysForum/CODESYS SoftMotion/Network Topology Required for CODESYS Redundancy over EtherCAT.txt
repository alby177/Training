Hello,I have been trying to set up a project with a Redundancy Configuration and am confused by some of the documentation.  Specifically, there is a diagram that describes fieldbus redundancy (see attached).The diagram in the documentation describes an EtherCAT network with multiple slaves and multiple masters.  Since this is contrary to the typical topology of EtherCAT (one master with multiple daisy-chained slaves), I am trying to determine what topology is required.  Do I need to use a ring or some kind of EtherCAT switch?  Is there a simpler way to set up the network?Thank You!
