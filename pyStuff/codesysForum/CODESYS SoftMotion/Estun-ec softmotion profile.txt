Hi,you need to rightclick in the devicetree and add DS402 generic drive, below/on your DS402 capable drive.BREdwin

yes. I find this topic (with panasonic is same) It will be working with soft motion if Drive use CanOpen over EtherCat?

Hi,yes should work (sure alway depend how close the drive implementeaion is on the DS402 standard)BREdwin

How about Codesys V2 RT SoftMotion. (as i understand it is only support CANopen) What PCI or USB to CAN adapter i can use for industrial PC to comunicate with CANopen Servo Drive and use SoftMotion features?
