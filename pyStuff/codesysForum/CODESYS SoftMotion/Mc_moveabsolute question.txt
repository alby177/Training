Hi all. As every plc-codesys manufacturer implements his own plcopen motion libraries which make codesys motion projects not portables, I am developing my own plc motion library.My question is.I can see that if an fb like mc-moveabsolute (or any other, like move_relative...) Is not executed every cycle when it has the axe control the axe goes to error. Does it be standard mandatory?. If yes, Why?For example: If a I am working with sfc, it make me possible to launch an fc_moveabsolute in one step and when the movement beguins transition to another step to do other things. In next step I can control if the movement has finished.

Hi Josep,in general there two solutions to do motion.Either the drives calculate the trajectory - you comand it (set where to go how fast and give the start)or in case of SoftMotion where you calc cyclic setpoints for all axis -> it is more or less mandatory to have this Kind of supervision of the motioncalculation (if the fb is not executed anymore-> goto an errorstate)BREdwin
