HiDoes anyone know how to change the destination folders using the package designer? I can happily change it by using %DESKTOP% for example in the TargetFolder field in the File item. However, it will always copy it across to Desktop/Component/File/<FileName>. How do I change the name the of the Component or File folder? So it could be something like Desktop/Motion Library/Examples/<FileName>.ThanksIain Riddell

Hi Iain,you do not need to change the component or file folder. Please set the file item's properties as follows:IgnoreArchiveFolder: TrueTargetFolder: %DESKTOP%/Motion Library/ExamplesNow the internal structure will be ignored and your folder will be created under the user's desktop.Matthias

For example is there an valid file path which points to the "My Documents" folder on the user's profile or other files such as the AppData. I know visual studio has "Environment.GetFolderPath(Environment.SpecialFolder.ApplicationData)" for pointing to the user's AppData folder.Kind RegardsIain Riddell
