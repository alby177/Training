Hi mazahar.mazahar wrote:[-] Install Message Handler - SucceededAction: Install message handler - SucceededIf you install a message handler you should also uninstall it. The problem occurs if you close the project while your message handler, which you installed after loading the project, is still installed.It's still a bug and so I opened CDS-38767 in our bug tracker.BRMartin
