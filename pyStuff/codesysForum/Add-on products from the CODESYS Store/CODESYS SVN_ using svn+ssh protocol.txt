I am currently using CODESYS V3.5 SP10 Patch 2 with CODESYS SVN V4.1.2.1, and am trying to set up a project to access a repository through the svn+ssh protocol.I know my server is configured correctly because I am able to run "svn checkout svn+ssh://user@server/path/to/project" and check out my project. However, when I try to enter an address with the svn+ssh protocol in CODESYS SVN a cygwin SSH terminal quickly pops up and dissapears. I am never prompted for any kind of authentication credentials, and I get the message "Unable to connect to a repository at URL 'svn+ssh://user@server/path/to/project'" in the checkout dialog. How can I get CODESYS SVN to authenticate using this protocol?
