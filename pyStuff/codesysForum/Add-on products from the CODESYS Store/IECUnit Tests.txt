Hi, I am developing some Unit Test and if I use the property "LanguageModelAttribute = qualified-access-only" inside my test library then the test will fail.It seems that the Unit test can not work with the namespace/prefix, is this behaviour correct?Thanks in advanceMark

The problem was reported a few weeks ago. See TM-258. The fix will be available with the next release. Unit then you have to remove the property from the Project Information if you want to use unit tests from a library.You also have to add the library to the list "Libraries to test" in the IEC Unit Test element of your test script.BRMartin
