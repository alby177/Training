Is there any possibility to use the svn:keywords feature in CODESYS SVN?I tried it by adding the property to an object, but this did not lead to success.No Replacements at all. It seems that this feature is not implemented yet?

Hi Martin,thank you for your immediate answer.I knew the SVN_VERSION_INFO already but it is not exactly what I want to have.For me it would be great to have all these informations per object.I guess there is no chance to achieve this goal?RegardsBruno

The dialog also shows other information about the object.BRMartin

This would be really great.Kind regardsBruno
