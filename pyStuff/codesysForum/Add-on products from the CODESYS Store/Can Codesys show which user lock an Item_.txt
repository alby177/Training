Hi All,Codesys show when an Item is locked, and can show which user make the last update. (With SVN info..) Can Codesys also show which user lock an Item?Regards, BakkertjeThe next software is used: Codesys V3.5 SP7 Patch 2, Test Manager 4.0.1.1. and SVN 4.0.3.0

Hi,Currently, the current lock owner is only shown when you try to lock the item, and the locking fails due to the existing lock.If you're interested, we could fiel your wish as an improvement request.
