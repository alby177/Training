Hi,we need to modify the source code of our Codesys project directly from C#.I've done some search in the Automation Platform documentation, tried all examples but i'm stuck at the Visitor Pattern, I really don't know how to handle this.What we want to do is, from C#, we need to add parameter {attribute} before an object in Codesys project that can be of type GVL, POU, Function, Enum, etc.In the document AP_Concepts_LanguageModelManager(page 34) there is an example for Visitor Pattern. I'm able to get the CompilationContext, CompiledPou , i've created an instance of "ChangeStatement" (it's Private in the example but i guess it should be Public)  but I don't know how to visit each element.Do you have a source code of an actual example modifying Codesys project source code from C# ?Regards,Dave

Hi Dave,please note, that CODESYS Forum is an end-user forum, where topics conserning the usage of CODESYS are discussed. Automation Platfrom is not an add-on or store product. It is not how to use CODESYS, but how CODESYS made of.The proper place for such discussions is Developer Networkhttp://dn.codesys.com/Here just a short answer.With language model expression visitor you can modify the language model (how the source is interpeted), but not a source code itself.If you want to modify a source code, you have to access the object (document AP_Concepts_LanguageModelManager is not about it at all).If you want to mofify a language model:1. Creare a pragma attribute statement using IPragmaStatement ILanguageModelBuilder3.CreatePragmaAttributeStatement(IExprementPosition pos, string attributeName, string attributeValue)2. The statement can be added/inserted with ISequenceStatement.AddStatemnt(IStatement) / ISequenceStatement.InsertStatement(int,IStatement) to desired part of language model tree.Regards,Roman

Hi Roman,thank you for clarification, I was really going the wrong way with LanguageModel.As suggested, i'll ask help on the developer networkRegards,Dave

Hi Dave,sorry for misleading answer - there is actually no forum for Automation Platform.Developer Network is a documentation/samples resource. Just contact Support for AP questions; your inquiry will be directed to responsible person.RegardsRoman
