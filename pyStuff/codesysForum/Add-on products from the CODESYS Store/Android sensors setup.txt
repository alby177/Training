Hello,Has anyone had experience with the android sensors add on. I have a raspberry pi with codesys. I can't for the life of me get the android phone to send updated values to the codesys controller. If anyone has a basic example or has done this please show me the way.

Hi,just use the Project from CODESYS store.Install it here:After install you'll find the project here:"c:\Users\<YourWindowsUserName>\CODESYS Examples\SensorAppForAndroid\1.4.0.0\AndroidSensorApp.project" -> then update the Project by rightclick to the project tree to your plc - set current compiler and current visu Profile.one remark you need to remove the library netvarupd 3.5.5.0 from the Project (this seems to be a bug) it pulls automatcally current Version on compile after doing this.BREdwin

One problem I have been having with the example program is that it includes two devices, Datagenerator and receiver. Do I load both devices to the raspberry pi and which one do I run?

Hi,You just need to download the second one... first one is only placeholder for the netvarlist. BREdwin

Thanks for the help so far but I am still unable to get it to work. I am getting a bunch of errors when I try to download to the device. Lets say I wanted to create a new project and just monitor screen rotation. How would I go about setting that up?

Hi,the most important is this list here:This must 100% fit, because These liste is exactly used in the android app to send the values:The upper Application is only a dummy application to have this list accessible as receive list.//This gobal variable list is received via the network.//Sender: NVL [SensorDataGenerator: PLC Logic: DataGenerator]//Protocol: UDPCode:VAR_GLOBAL   wVersion: WORD := 16#00_01;   wCounter: WORD;   dwFeatures: DWORD;   Data: SensorValues;   strCommand: STRING(70);END_VARBREdwin

Do I have to use the devices hotspot to connect the controller, or can they both just be on the same network interface?

Hi,they need to be in the same network (android and plc)BREdwin
