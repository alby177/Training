Hi,I am executing an automated non-volatile test script through the test manager. The intention of the test is to verify that the PERSISTENT and RETAIN variables can co-exist in the same memory space and the expected test steps are as follows,1. Allocate PERSISTENT data of max non-volatile memory size and no RETAIN data2. Log in to the device and start the application3. Verify that the log in does not raise any exceptions/compile errors4. Log out of the device5. Change the PERSISTENT declaration. Allocate PERSISTENT data of half the max non-volatile memory size6. Allocate RETAIN data of half the max non-volatile memory size7. Open PERSISTENT Variable editor8. Go to Declarations-> Reorder list and clear gaps9. Clean All10. Log in to the device and start the application11. Verify that the log in does not raise any exceptions/compile errorsI hope the sequence of test steps mentioned above are good enough for the test. My question is - how to perform steps 7 and 8 using test manager?Best Regards,Mazahar
