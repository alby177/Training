Hi,I am using the command line tool 'PackageManagerCLI.exe' to install/uninstall the latest packages as part of automated validation testing. I want to know if it is possible to get the installed packages list and their current versions from the command line tool.Many Thanks,Mazahar S

Hi,It seems that this is currently not possible yet. I did forward your request to the developers, so it can be filed as an improvement in our issue database eventually.HTH,Markus
