1. Is it possible to disable some Static Analysis errors/warning when my POU is implemented in CFC? I know in ST code I can use pragmas {analysis '-...'}, but unsure if anything similar is possible on CFC code.2. In some cases Static Analysis gives me warnings and I cannot disable them with pragmas. For example:I generate a persistent variables list like below:Code:{attribute 'qualified_only'}VAR_GLOBAL PERSISTENT RETAIN   {attribute 'analysis' := '-12'}   g_xCheck:      BOOL := FALSE;   {attribute 'analysis' := '-12'}   g_sText:      STRING := 'abc';END_VARThen I place these variables somewhere in a Visualizaiton. The Static Analysis still reports "SA0012: g_xCheck could be declared as constant." - despite of the usage of pragma {attribute 'analysis' := '-12'}. I would like to disable it. What am I missing?
