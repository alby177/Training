Hi,1 -> With "CODESYS Control for PFC200 SL, version 3.5.8.0" (and CODESYS V3.5 SP8),if I add a modbus/Tcp master and a modbus slave I obtain (see the joined image) twice: "C0080:  Functionblock 'IoDrvModbusTCP' must be instantiated to be accessed".2 -> Furthermore, when I create a channel (item "Canal esclave Modbus") it is impossible to change/choose the "offset"of a modbus channel.Please do you have a solution?Thanks in advance for your help!

Hi,"C0080: Functionblock 'IoDrvModbusTCP' must be instantiated to be accessed"is an precompile error (wrong message from CODESYS),this will be solved to 3.5SP8Patch1 (mid February release)This has no functional restriction you could download and use your project without any problem.According your modbus problem:Which functioncode are you using?In my case this works see screenshot.BREdwin

Edwin,Thanks for your answers.I want to use the "Function code 6" (Write Single Register).Impossible (for me) to add a canal with this function (#6)and an "Offset" value to (for example) 0x0001... Very curious!!BR

Hi,hm.... here?BREdwin

Hi Edwin,If I add a channel with 0x0010 as offset value, it's Ok!The same thing with an offset of 0x0001, it's not Ok,in the ModbusChannel window I have "Default"in place of my offset (0x0001), and the "OK button" is disabled.BR,Thierry

Hi,ok now I understand.You could write into this field your offset by using for example 0x0010this will work without problems.Selecting this predefined values does not work , sense of that would be if you customize the modbus slave description.(Some how not really finished - will add an bugtracker entry for this)BREdwin

Edwin,Ok! Thanks for your help.BR,Thierry
