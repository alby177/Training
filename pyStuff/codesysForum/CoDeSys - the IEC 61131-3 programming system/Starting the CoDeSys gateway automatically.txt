I am using an OPC server to connect to my PLC.  When my computer is booted up, I would like the gateway to start automatically.

Is there a windows service or a command line parameter that I can use to make this work? 

Thanks for any help you can give.

I was finally able to answer my own question to those who are interested.  In windows services, you can select the CoDeSys Gateway service to start automatically rather than the default of manual start.

Well.. Now I have a new issue / question.  I can get the gateway to start when the PC is started by changing the service type to automatic. But when you close CoDeSys V3, the gateway is stopped again. 

Is there anyway that I can prevent the gateway from being stopped?
