Hello there!I am trying to specify the current absolute position as the new zero(0). This would make it easier for me to restore the functionality when something happens and my device is runned while it is powered off. I am using LMC20(Schneider Electric) and Lexium32 servo drives. In the SoLite software for servo drives configuration there is an option to specify that the current location should be zero.I am pretty sure it's possible via code too.What I did was to take a look at the documentation of MC_Home but was unable to find the right configuration which serves in my case. I also found out the MC_SetPosition block but it was not documented in details and I didn't understand whether it is close to what I was looking for.I understand my problem can be pretty stupid but as I said in my other post, I am new to CodeSys and I am still struggling with it.

Hello,two possibilities,1. use MC_SetPosition this sets the axis SetPosition to your desired value (0 in that case)2. another option use the Homing mode 35 in the Lexium (this homing mode could be set by the drivetool or via an write on SDO 0x6098 for this you could use fb SMC_WriteCANParameter from SM_CAN.lib)cuEdwin
