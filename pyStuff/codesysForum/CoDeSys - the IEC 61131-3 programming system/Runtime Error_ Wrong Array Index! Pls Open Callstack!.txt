Hi, everyone! Here's a phenomenon I don't quite understand.In SIMULATION MODEï¼Œ I try to run my project, then a dialog box appears, saying"Runtime Error: Wrong Arrry Index! Please Open Callstack". I opened the callstack, it point to a line in a task, but I don't find anything weird in that line. I make some change in the program, still error, and this time the callstack point to a line without a word!If someone knows this phenomenon, pls tell me what is the reason! thanks!Sunzc

Hello,Can you possibly post the project too? Or copy and paste the part of the code that gives the problem?/Kristian

thanks for attension, here's the project and eds file needed.

your program setting not correct, or the arrays are too big to hold, and they will overflow inside another memory area.another one can be not closing your subroutines correct, like use the exit wrong, it will grow your stack.
