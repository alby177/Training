I'm writing a program (ST language) using codesys 2.3.9.42 and my target hardware is Wago 758-874, if I build the program without the simulation flag(Online - Simulation Mode) I have no error. The build process give this information:POU indices 1108 27%Size of used data: 672426 of 134217729 bytes (0.50%)Size of used retain data : 62444 of 1040128 bytes (6%).Now if I use Simulation and and I try to clean and build the same program I have 4 errors similar to this:Error 3101: Data area too large: 97177 Byte/s (95K). Maximum size: 65535 Byte/s /63K).Is it possible that in simulation mode Codesys has a memory limit that is smaller than the real limit of my target setting?Thanks. Carlo

yes the simulation is limited, and is not dependent of the target, you can change this in sourcesif you have oscat the memory is very fast filled.

Where is the option to change the memory in simulation mode? I don't find "sources".. Thanks, Carlo

it is in your target settings under resources(right bottom tab

Hi Carlo     Did you Select PLCWInNT and in Target Settings go to Memory Lay Out to change no of POU and Memory Limit.RegardsSarath
