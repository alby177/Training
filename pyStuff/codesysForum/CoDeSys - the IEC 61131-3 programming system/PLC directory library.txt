Hi there,I have a question in regards to the use of PLC directory library, specifically for a WAGO 750-871. My intent is to create a button which when clicked will download a data file (.csv) that was created in a POU. I have been unsuccessful up until now. I have also tried messing around with the PLC browser to figure out the directory path for the file, but to no avail. Well, to add another layer I haven't ever used the PLC browser until now. I am still trying to figure out its purpose. I have perused through a number of forum posts and have not yet found what I am looking for, so any help would be greatly appreciated.Regards,Pardeep
