HelloI'm new to Codesys software and i have tried to find an answer in the earlier topics.In my application I'm communicating with a top system via a serial interface, the top system uses the PLC as a database to read and write data, I want to use a 4 byte ASC with the adress value e.g 0100 which i will translate to %R0.100 which is the actual adress to be written or read.Can I extract the string value and use it as a pointer?  RegardsSvante

no you can not make a variable, however you can use an array like arrayQ[100].

have a look at www.oscat.de for a library with lots of functions with pointers etc.

Ok thanks for the reply, OSCAT seems to a goldmine to be explored.
