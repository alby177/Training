Hello,

I'm using CoDeSys 2.3.9.14 and the following command file is broken:
file open MyPorject.pro /readpwd:<mypassword>
is not working anymore in batch mode

Ok finally found,

the cmd parser is not using < and > anymore with readpwd and writepwd (you need them in prior versions else it was not working).

So must write now:
file open MyPorject.pro /readpwd:mypassword

note: tested with 2.3.9.19
