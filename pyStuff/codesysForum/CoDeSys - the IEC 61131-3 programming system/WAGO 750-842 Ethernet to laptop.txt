Hi all,I'm using WAGO 750-842 PLC with Ethernet port. I've connected its Ethernet port to my Window 7 laptop using a crossover cable. I'm trying to use my laptop to control it through CoDeSys v2.3.I've tried to assign IP to the PLC using BootP server from WAGO. When it should request Ethernet address from PLC Mac ID, it keep request Ethernet address from my laptop Physical address.Is there anything that i'm missing?Thank you^^

if your ip address is 192.168.1.3, then set "use the following ip address" to 192.168.1.20then in codesys.. online.. communication parameters.. new.. ethernet tcp.. then type in the ip address of your device.. that should work

the wago has an address, normally something like 192.168.1.1type in command line ping on your computer.The address of your computer should be something like 192.168.1.100 for exampleAt this moment you can use the codesys program.set the communication like you have done.now you will have communication with the unit.As long as the addresses are not correct you can not talk obvious.you can also use the program WAGO ETHERNET SETTINGS along with the programming cable, this way you can set the internal address of the wago.(no other way for starters)

there's free software called wago ethernet settings that should have came with it, or you can get it off their websitewith that, you use the wago usb/serial service cable to connect to your plc, then assign it an ip addressbut you said you connected it to your other computer so i assume you've already assigned it an IP address.. I'm actually using the address 192.168.1.3, and for the ip settings i have:"use the following ip address:ip address: 192.168.1.20subnet mask: 255.255.255.0" and it works fineyou need to make the last number of the ip higher than that of your wago system

It works now,thx evryone for the helps given^^
