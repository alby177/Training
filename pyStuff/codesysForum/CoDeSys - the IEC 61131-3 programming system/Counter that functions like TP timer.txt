I need a counter function that acts like a TP timer. Meaning when the counting begins the output goes high and remains high until the counting PV is reached. Once the PV is reached the output goes low. The program I am creating functions off a pulsing digital input and I need to count the pulses but keep an output on while it's counting.If you don't know of a built in function can you suggest to me a way I can create one with ladder logic.I appreciate any assistance I can get with this.Thank you   

so you need a downcounter, and when the start is true and the counter is NOT at zero the flag is TRUE.

Yes, that is the concept. I've been trying to recreate with no luck/

send an export file of what you made and i will give you the filling.

I'm not exactly sure how to export so I'm sending a screen shot. HOPE this is ok

again:when you start counting you set a flag to ONwhen counter is at setpoint you reset the flag.that is all.you can use rising_edge to have this flag give a pulse to the next POU for example to close the bag because it is filled.
