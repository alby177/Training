Hello,
There is list of documentation available in German, Russian and Portuguese languages on 3S web-site -
http://3s-software.com/index.shtml?Technical_Literature_E

Is there not any literature in English language?
I think it will have global audience.

I am looking for literature on CoDeSys V3, especially new Object Oriented Concepts with programming examples and other new features.

Online Help in CoDeSys V3 is always available, but E-Book or sort of training literature will be quite helpful.
