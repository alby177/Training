I generate PLC code by Matlab and then input the whole PLC code into CoDesys to test them.But I do not know how to run my Plc code and see the result of the testï¼Ÿthank you for anybody who could help me

in Codesys you will need to set some testing vars and in online mode set the simulation flag.btw i am very interested in how you convert from matlab to codesys, so please if you would like to send a small program in matlab together with the conversion i would love to check if it is going correct.

Hi        Can you tell me how you are converting matlab code to plc code am interested to see it as I use matlab for system analysisThanks

I have seen both matlab and codesys programs, however there is not any comment and i have no idea what you can do with the matlab file.so break it in pieces and give me a clue what the function is.I am not that good in matlab, but it looks like the conversion gives some results.Try to make the matlab not too complicated as the exp file will have cases in cases and that is hard to read.I do not understand your subsystem1 (which you converted) but the codesys software is doing its job.i made a small project for it.
