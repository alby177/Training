I am new to CoDeSys and J1939, but have been programming controllers and PLCs for a long time.I am trying to receive messages from a joystick, but I'm not getting an address match (RX_SingleFrame.AddressMatch = false). The header looks like this: 0x0CFDD633, which is a PGN of 0xFDD6, and an SA of 0x33, correct? Here's how I have PGN_Register set up:Name: WJSL_PGNi_CanDrvNbr: 1i_PGN: 16#FDD6i_DA: 5o_Element: {blank}Here's how RX_SingleFrame is set up:i_Enable: truei_Element: WJSL_PGN.o_Elementi_Timeout: T#250msi_CanDrvNbr: 1Here's what the data looks in CANmoon:0xCFDD633 01 00 01 00 FF 00 FF FFWhat tools can I use to troubleshoot this?TIA!Gyz
