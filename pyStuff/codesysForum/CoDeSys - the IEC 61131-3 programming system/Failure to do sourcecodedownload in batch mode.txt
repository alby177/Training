Hi Folks,

I'm trying to create a boot project and do sourcecode download on my build server and I'd like to avoid having any hardware plugged into it.  I'm using the following command line to run Codesys:

Build.bat:
Code:"C:\Program Files\3S Software\CoDeSys V2.3\Codesys.exe" OptimusPlcFirmware.pro /cmd Build.cmd /batchBuild.cmd:Code:echo ononline sim offproject rebuildonline bootprojectonline simonline loginonline sourcecodedownloadonline logoutonline sim off

When I do this I get the windows "has encountered a problem and needs to close, with accompanying Send Error Report / Don't Send buttons"

The boot project has been created succesfully and the sourcecode all seems correct. Can anyone explain what's happening?

Thanks

Matt
