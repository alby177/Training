hey hey!

i would like to ask for help guys...

we bought a new coupler 758-870/000-111
and we are using codesys 2.3

the problem is that its not listed in targets (when we are creating the priject, or editing an existing one), and i wasnt able to find the tnf file for it. so we cant connect to it from codesys..any help please?

thanx in advance

I think you should visit wago.com site and search for the target there. As well contact your WAGO support manager for help.

i did try to look on wago site, but i wasnt able to find it there 

..but anyways, i think wago aint the place to look for, since its codesys file i need to install..thats why im asking here..

nvm..

its sorted now, we had to call our wago supplier and he sent us a some tool that install additional target files..
