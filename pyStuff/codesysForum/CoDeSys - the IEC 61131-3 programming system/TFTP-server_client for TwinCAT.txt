Hi,

Have anyone tried to create an TFTP-server/client for TwinCAT? I have to pass a simple txt-file from Beckhoff PC (programmed using TwinCAT) to KEB PLC (programmed in CoDeSys).

I have a special KEB library which contains TFTP function blocks but don't have any FTP function block. On the other hand, Beckhoff have only FTP libraries, not TFTP. I know it sounds very stupid... Beckhoff engineers in Russia told me that they don't have any idea how to solve my problem. After I had asked my question to KEB in Germany they answered that they can't help me too.

So, I need to create TFTP connection between Beckhoff PC and KEB PLC. The problem is libraries for these both devices include different type of FTP functionality. I would be happy to find here the solution. Of course, it's possible to send data using Modbus TCP but I don't want to manage so many registers. I'm just looking for the easiest way.
