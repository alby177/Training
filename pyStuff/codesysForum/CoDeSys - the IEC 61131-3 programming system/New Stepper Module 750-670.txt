We have just received a 750-670 stepper module to integrate into a new project only to find there is no manual available. We hope to close the position loop with a 2 channel quadrature encoder (no marker) into a 750-631/000-010 incremental encoder interface. We have found the published Stepper_02.lib library and have downloaded the newest CoDeSys software required to use the module.
Any idea where to get more information on the stepper module or this type integration would be appreciated.
