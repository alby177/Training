Hi,

I have a program made with CoDeSys and that can run on multiple target:
Wago 750-841, 750-871, 750-849, etc.

I'm using the USR led that exist on these devices and that can be blink programmatically.

To warn the user that the PLC is in RUN or STOP I'm using system events to run some PRG : LED_START_PRG, LED_STOP_PRG (wichh are called nowhere).

A problem occured when I'm doing a target change, because system events are cleared but a bug seems to be present because when I upload the rebuilt project to the PLC it turns to a failure mode when set to run.

I'm using a telnet connection with the PLC serial cable to see that the error occured when calling the LED_START_PRG (that should not be called as system events table has been cleared and concerned programs are not built and linked in the binary file, they are grayed).

Any idea to fix this issue, because every time I forgot to re-add system events on target change, I'm crashing the PLC.
