Hi all,

Want to reset a TOF (turn-off delay) timer in my code. Any suggestions on the easiest way to implement this ?

Usually you just drop the .IN bit of the timer.   The accumulator will go to zero.

If you want a timer that keeps resetting itself, then use the NOT of the .DN bit.


 Exact forms depend on whether you are using ST, or FB, of IL, or LD...

In typical TOF, the Q output will continune to be ON till the time elapses. 
If your problem is to reset the Q output forcefully, bypassing the time then you need to make a trick. This may be required in some emergencies. 


In such cases, just move t#0s to PT (with emergency condition, of course) and Q shall go OFF.

I hope this answers your problem.

Use a trigger on the input with your reset a negate input on an and gate together with your normal input.
