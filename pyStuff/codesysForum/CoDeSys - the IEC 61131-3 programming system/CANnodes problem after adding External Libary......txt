Hello,I have created an external library via Vusal C++. It gives acctuare result and normally i can also use it in CoDeSys. But  when I used this library with CANopen Nodes (DSP 402 or DSP 410) then CAN nodes not work accurately.It also takes more time to go nStatus =5. And some times CAN nodes do not work. normally my project is accurate as I have run it with oscat libary. But after using external library, The CAN nodes  give strange behaviour. I have not really any idea. Is it happening for the time of linking the external library?Please tell me if anybody has suggestions.Thanks,Asif
