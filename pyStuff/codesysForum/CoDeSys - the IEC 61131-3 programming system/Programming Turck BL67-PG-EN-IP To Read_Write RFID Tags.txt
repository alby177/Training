Hello all - I'm new to CoDeSys and I'm totally lost as to what I need to do and I'm looking for some assistance.  I have an application where I need to read a RFID tag ID and based off the ID write information to it and be able to pull up that information.  I'm using an AB Compactlogix processor and AB RFID tags.  I'm using a Turck BL67-PG-EN-IP and ethernet is my communication protocol.  The customer has already given me the format of a UDT that they plan to use for the storage/transfer of tag information.  It's an array that has 73 elements.  If someone could point me in a starting direction I would greatly appreciate it.  Thanks in advance.
