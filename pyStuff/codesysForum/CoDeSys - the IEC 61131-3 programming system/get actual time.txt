Hello,I am an obvious newbie to CoDeSys so this is probably a dumb beginners question, but I´ve Googled around and could not find any satisfiable answer.How can a get the current time from my controller (a Wago 750-841)I want to start with a simple time clock which sets an output on or off according to the time of the day. Found the OSCAT library which contains a function for this purpose (TIMECHECK) this function needs an input in TOD type. The OSCAT libraries also contain functions to convert from different types to TOD, but my problem is I don´t know how to get the time in any format from the system.I´ve tried the CurTime and CurTimeEx functions but the seem to need inputs. I don´t want to set the time just read it.Can anyone give a hint on how to accomplish this probably simple task.thanks in advance,Arjan

inside 750-841 is no RTC present so you can not ask for it.you can give a time when startup and then the time will be running (not very good on time though but you can make calcs with it.

Hi,the 750-841 has a battery buffered RTC.You can get the actual time with the 'SysRtcGetTime' function from the SysLibRtc.lib.VARMyDateTime: DT;END_VARMyDateTime := SysRtcGetTime(TRUE);Nitro

Hello Nitro,Thanks that was what I was looking for.Maybe the clock of the 750-841 is not to accurate, but that is no problem for my application.Do you know of any documentation (pdf´s or websites) where these standard functions are explained some more and maybe easy to browse by categories etc.?Greetz,Arjan

Hi,you can find a lot of informations on the WAGO WebsiteService >> Downloads >> Automationalso you can visit http://www.oscat.de/, a free library (open Source)Nitro

Hello everyone,I am using Codesys 2.3 with target SP RTE. I have already found "SysLibTime" and "SysLibRtc".I have also need to use Real system time in my ST editor.  I have run the above small program as described above but I have this old time.VAR	MyDateTime:DT;END_VARMyDateTime := SysRtcGetTime(TRUE);Then result: DT#1970-01-01-00:00 It is not currect date & time system time.If I  add and use "SysLibTime" library in my project then I have just write in Visualisation %t%a %b %d.%m.%y %H:%M:%S  then i have the real system time in Visualisation.It is very nice.But I can only see not use it ST editor.how can i use this? or any idea?As I want to get the system time and then i want to use it again. how can i get this time in "Main "or " PLC_PRG"  Program editor in ST language?I am waititng for ur reply.Thanksasif

I have the same problem. The example "MyDateTime := SysRtcGetTime(TRUE);" gives  " DT#1970-01-01-00:00 ". I'm using a 750-841 controller and the time in the wago is correct.Anyone already a solution.Thanks,CME

Hello, I've used CurTimeEx (not to set time and date, but only to read it) and it works well.In the declarations:VAR	ActualTime:SysTime64;	ActualTimeEx:SystemTimeDate;	RdCurTimeEx: CurTimeEx;END_VARIn the program part:	RdCurTimeEx(SystemTime:=ActualTime , TimeDate:= ActualTimeEx);ActualTimeEx has now the time and date values.I use Lenze HMI(WCE) and IPC(WCE) and this works on both.
