Hi,

I'm wondering how it's possible for the function SysDirRead in the library SysLibDir to write to the VAR_INPUT variable stDirEntry.


Best regards,

Hi Kristian,
thats a interesting question. I also didn't belive it but it works. So I asked arround and got the following answer:
In Version 3 strings in input sections functions a generally handled as references to the variable. Means for strings it works like VarInOut.

By the way do you join us in July?

Hello Ralph,

I was trying it in version 2.3 though. 

Yes, I am glad to say that I'm coming to Kempten in July.

Best regards,
Kristian

Sorry I wrote nonsense. It works in Version 2 like discribed in Version 3 you have to use VarInOut a reference or pointer to do such things.
