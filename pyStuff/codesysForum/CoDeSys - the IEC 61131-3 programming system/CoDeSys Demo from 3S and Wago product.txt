Wago tell me : you have to use Codesys for Wago !

WAGO-I/O-PRO CAA Demo 


http://www.wago.com/cps/rde/xchg/SID-53 ... a_9377.htm

you need target installation file,you have to pay, i think

yes you can use codesys on wago no problem, however in demo you can not use the programs as it is only a demo.

and i/o pro is the old version with same restrictions btw.
