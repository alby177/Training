Hello, i have a beginner's question. In the company have wago 758-870 plc where i need to make a backup program that is stored in it. So i trying to connect through network switch where is connect two wago plc's, my manual setting on the laptop is ip 192.168.0.128 and subnet mask 255.255.0.0. with WAGO Ethernet Settings i see plc's address is 192.168.0.50 (this is main plc i think) and second is 192.168.0.100 (plc for joystick) but program say for both not supported dont know why. Ok i run codesys v2.3 choose open program from plc pick target settings Wago 758-870-000-012 which writes on the plc sticker, now ask me for communication parameters i choose localhost via tcp/ip in address i write 192.168.0.50, port 1200, targetid is 0, motorola byteorder is yes, gateway option is connection tcp/ip, address is localhost and port is 1210. When i press ok open window and says loading program from plc, gateway server start light but after a minute i get an error communication error (#0) logout performed.So can anyone tell me where I'm wrong and how to solve it? Another question is what is needed to choose for complete backup just choose save codesys project? Sorry for the newbie question i need some directions for begin  Thanks!!

In most cases it is impossible to load the program from PLC to PC. as it does not exist in the PLC.

no.. program exists in the PLC, PLC is in operation 7 years. I already have a backup of the PLC which i got from developers who programmed it. Since it is already changed several times, i want to make a new backup, but i have a problem connecting laptop to plc. I see him on the network, but every time when i connect and start load program from PLC i get communication error (#0) logout performed. here is log file from gateway server.##INSPECTOR-LOG-FILE####SECTION:HEADER##Instance='localhost' via Tcp/Ip_Driver=Tcp/Ip (Level 2 Route)	Address=192.168.0.50;IP address or hostname	Port=1200	TargetId=0	Motorola byteorder=YesProject=Channel=1	Created=2015-07-07 12:46:05.328	Client=127.0.0.1##SECTION:TRACE####NEW DATE: 2015-07-07####NEW SYMBOLS '' (Version = 0, Identity = 0, Symbols = 0): 12:46:05.328##System DWord	12:46:05.328  Set    	 Idx=5 (TARGETCHANNEL), Value=4294967295, Result=1System DWord	12:46:05.328  Get    	 Idx=4 (BUFFERSIZE), Result=65496System DWord	12:46:05.328  Set    	 Idx=1 (TRIES), Value=3, Result=1System DWord	12:46:05.328  Set    	 Idx=2 (TIMEOUT), Value=22000, Result=1	12:46:49.546  Error	 Value=9, WindowsSocketError=0x0System DWord	12:47:11.343  Get    	 Idx=5 (TARGETCHANNEL), Result=4294967295##SECTION:SUMMARY##Terminated=2015-07-07 12:47:11.343Quality=Unknown	Total=0	Failed=0	Âµs per read=Unknown	12:47:11.750  Error	 Value=9, WindowsSocketError=0x0	12:47:11.953  Error	 Value=1, Param=0What means Error	 Value=9, WindowsSocketError=0x0?Thanks!
