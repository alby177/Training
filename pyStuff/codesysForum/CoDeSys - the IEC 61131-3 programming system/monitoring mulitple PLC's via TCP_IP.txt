Greetings everyone,

I am logging in an monitoring multiple projects (3 at the moment) running on three different PLC's using a network hub.  Once I start running I lose communication after a period of time (< 15 - 20 s) to one of the PLC's.  All 3 applications are running fine, just no communications (LOGIN) to one of them.  Any ideas or is this not possible due to limitations of TCP/IP or CoDeSys?

Doug,
I am monitoring 3 PLC's using CoDeSys on this computer as I write this with no trouble.  I sometimes monitor 5.

There's no problem with CoDeSys or TCP/IP.  It may be that you're using a hub.  I found that using a switch insteadof a hub works better.

does this mean you have 3 instances of codesys running on the PC?yes that is a bit much.better use visualisation or ODP.
