Hello,Can anybody tells me that why i have errors when I have creating an external Library in Visual c++. As normally I have no error when I create a simple external library with C (without SIN, COS or math.h) like  A=B+C;But when I write trigonometric function program (Y=SIN X ) with math.h in Visual C++ with Functional Block  then I have two errors.Error:C:\DOCUMENTS AND SETTINGS\WIM\MIJN DOCUMENTEN\CODESYSTEST11\SIN_LIB.OBJ' (Symbol '_sin', Class 'EXTERNAL', Type 'REL32')Error:C:\DOCUMENTS AND SETTINGS\WIM\MIJN DOCUMENTEN\CODESYSTEST11\SIN_LIB.OBJ' (Symbol '_RTC_CheakEsp, Class 'EXTERNAL', Type 'REL32')Please give a small idea as I need to create a external library where I have to use lot of SIN COS TAN.  ThanksAsif 

why you need to go external,SIN is inside codesys and if needed better progs look at www.oscat.de(i saw btw 32bit, is this same type as in codesys?

Hi shooter,Basically i can use SIN, COS TAN in CodeSys and I already used it. It is not my problem. I have a big Sun position algorithm and it is huge big, Anyway I want to link that C Code (Sun position algorithm) where math.h is present as external library. but I can not create an external library for math.h. So at first i want to create a simple external libray for math.h and with SIN, COS function. then I want to make an external library  for big SUN position algorithm. I hope, you got my problem.......ByeAsif
