Does anyone know - or have a document - for the file format specification for the codesys pro files?

I'm trying to automatically stamp a version number directly into the pro file during our automated build process, we will then query this number using the PROJECT_INFO structure.

Thanks

Matt

Take a project and open it with a text editor. You will see that it is basically a text file with some header information. I think with an easy parser you should be able to find some specific Tag within the file and change the value.

Sorry I forgot to add. Someone from 3S would need to let you know if there is a checksum involved. You may get corrupted files. 

I was right. I tried editing a *.pro with notepad and saved it. Reopened with CoDeSys and it stated that the project was corrupt but it did give me the option to continue. I did and my changes from notepad took effect.

I would be insterested by such a feature.

I think that modifying the pro file is not the right method. You may cause corruption of the project file. Moreover, this format may change with a newer version of CoDeSys. 

I looked at the different method for automating CoDeSys 2.3: Import/Export, batchinterface and MessageIntreface and it seems that unfortunately the modification of the Project Info is not supported by these methods.
It may be possible to do it thanks to the COM interface but I am misisng information about it.

Could you attach here sample how looks .pro file opened with notepad? Because I tried but inside isn't possible to understand and find anything.

you can also use the version block from any library.or make your own version block.this way you do it inside codesys easier.

No, no...The problem is that when I tried to open the project received message "project is corrupted". Now I tried to open it with notepad, just to see inside (to take some info from there) . Unfortunately all inside are not understandable. Do you have some ideas in my case?Best regards,Hristo Mihalev
