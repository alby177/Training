Hi all,

I need to source the protocol used by codesys software for sending PLC programs. We need to send program via radio modem to a RTU and then the RTU will send program to PLC. However, we will not have codesys on RTU. 

RTU is PC based and can send data if we have the correct commands and protocol details. RTU cannot run codesys however. PLC program is done in codesys on local PC and then sent as update to remote sites.

Please let me know if you can help.

I'd be interested as well, but

CoDeSys uses the correct compiler and compiles the PLC code to machine code. Does CoDeSys do this on the fly or does it create an external file? In earlier versions of CoDeSys it would generate the .hex file that was the compiled file. How can you download something if you don't have the machine file?

Hello,Even I would want to know if a .hex file can be generated from the codesys 3.5 application. This is because I can download only .hex on the device I use.Thanks,Rachana
