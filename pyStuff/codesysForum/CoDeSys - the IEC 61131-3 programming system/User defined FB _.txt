Hi all, I think there must be a way to combine several function blocks in a sort of user defined block. For example, the combination of the attachment to be made on a block with the required number of inputs and outputs to be used repeatedly.If yes - where in the HELP I can find a description of how this can be done. Even a keyword to search what will be helpful.[attachment=0]CoDeSys01.PNG[/attachment]Thanks in advance 

if you make a new POU you can set it if it is a program a function block (your user block) and as a function.when you make it and you press F11 you can use your own block wherever you want it.

How do I define this block, so that it appears with the necessary inputs and outputs? May be I have to define them on some specific way, but HELP doesn't say nothing about this.... or I can't find it?!

You need to define the inputs and outputs for the function block.VAR_INPUT and VAR_OUTPUT define the inputs and outputs to your user defined function block.  See the help information for how to do this.  It is in there.Attachment:VAR.PNG
