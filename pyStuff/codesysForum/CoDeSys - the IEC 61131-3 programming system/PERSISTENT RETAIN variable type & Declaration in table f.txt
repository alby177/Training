Hello everyone
I came across strange issue. I have some variable of type PERSISTENT RETAIN and when I switch declaration view from text to table form, PERSISTANT is getting stripped out and moved into VAR section like variable NAME.  So, when I covert back to text format, declaration of  PERSISTENT RETAIN variables changes to  RETAIN and  PERSISTENT becomes its own varible. Here is an exampe.
I start with 
VAR PERSISTENT RETAIN
	testPersistantVar: BOOL := TRUE;
END_VAR
Then I go to table format and back to text, the declaration changes to 
VAR RETAIN
	PERSISTENT: BOOL := TRUE;
	testPersistantVar: BOOL := TRUE;
END_VAR
Is this a bug in CoDeSys? Is there a way to create varibale PERSISTENT RETAIN in table format?
I am using CoDeSys version 2.3.5.8
Thanks
