My devices refuses to create a boot project whatever I am trying.It says "The last online service has not been successful". I can't understand where the problem might be.The program is successfully runnable when I download it manually with Login->Run?

hello,if you use the LMC20 this is only possible if the device is in STOP. (this is LMC20 speficic other plc's could write the bootproject even if they are in run mode)Use CASE for creating bootproject is:1. Go online (download appliaction)2. create bootapplication before you press F5 ... start the applicationor if application is runnning -> Online - Stop - > create Bootproject -> the start the project again (online start)hope this helps.cuEdwin

Edwin, thanks for the reply.Unfortunately, I have already tried that.1) Stop the PLC2) Create a boot project ---> a message box saying "default.PRG", then "Checking boot project...". Then, everything seems successful, I running the PLC. However, after cutting the power and getting the plc back ON, there is no program.What can be causing this?I was also told to check the DIP switches:1 -> ON, 2 ->OFF, 3->ON, 4->OFF but that didn't help either.

hi,hm, then next step should be to contact the schneider electric support.cuEdwin

Hello Edwin.Today it turned out that the Schneider support guy has told me a wrong combination for DIP switches. Will try again and let you know.
