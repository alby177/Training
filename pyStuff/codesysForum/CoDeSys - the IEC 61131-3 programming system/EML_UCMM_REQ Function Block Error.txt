Hi there   This being me first post on a forum, please bear with me. I have recently been dropped in the deep end with PLC programming and encountered my first real issue while attempting to make a WAGO 750-841 module "talk" to an Allen-Bradley Logix5562 module:I followed this guide: http://www.wago.com/wagoweb/documentation/app_note/a2032/a203200e.pdf and all is hunky-dory until page 11. As you will see in the screenshot in the guide, the "TAG" and "TAG_SIZE" inputs to the "EML_UCMM_REQ" function block have been left blank for both instances E1 and E2. This is, apparently, a non-issue because the succeeding sentence goes on without any mention of an error occurring at this stage. However, in my case, when I press "Project" -> "Rebuild all" I am presented with error messages as illustrated in the the attached image.I have searched high and low for a solution, but only became more confused when I found the following document http://www.wago.com/wagoweb/documentation/app_note/a2030/a203000e.pdf where on page 12 there is a screenshot similar to the one in the guide I followed, with the same function block inputs left blank. BUT on page 17 of http://www.wago.com/wagoweb/documentation/app_note/a2036/a203600e.pdf those inputs are assigned initial values in a structured Test file. There is no mention of creating a ST file for tis purpose in either of the other cases, given that the applications are obviously completely different.I would really like to know what I am doing wrong, or at least advice on where to find information to educate myself enough to figure it out myself. Cheers,Stef

Hi!Short remark. The compiler is complaining about the network_path not the tag.Usually the any IP adresses are written in string format. And you have not what I can see.Try to make the adress as string by, adding ' '. Like '127.0.0.1'. Or make a variable as string./Torbjörn

Hi,Thank you Torbjörn, that sorted it out! Rookie error on my part  Cheers, Stef
