Hi All,I am quite new to CodeSys and have a queestion.I need to convert a Decimal or Hex to ASCII.Is there a simple way of doing it?

To convert a dÃ©cimal digit to ASCII, you have to ADD 50 to your decimal digit.For example : 5 (decimal digit) --> 5 + 50 = 55                55 is decimal ASCII code for decimal digit 5To convert a hexadigit to ASCII, you have to ADD 16#30 to your decimal digit.For example : 5 (decimal digit) --> 5 + 30 = 35           16#35 is hexa ASCII code for decimal digit 5To convert a number you must isolate each digit includes the number, then add 50 or 16#30 to each isolate digitFor example to convert VAL1 to ASCII code :------------------------------VARVal1:UINT:=24;VAL2, Dec_ASCII,Unit_ASCII : UINT;END_VAR------------------------------(*Program*)(*Decade*)Val2:=Val1/10                     (*result =2, decade*)(*ASCII code for decade*)Dec_ASCII:= Val1 + 50 = 52  (*ASCII code for "2" *)(*ASCII code for unit*)Unit_ASCII:= (Val1-(10 x Val2)) + 50 = 4 + 50 = 54  (*ASCII code for "4", unit*)------------------------------In this example, Val1 is only composed of 2 digits.The program will be longer if val1 is more long !

Thanks for that.Is there anyway to show the careracter of the ASCII code?For example, I need to send "SMFHD4BCOCGKS1508" over CANSo I have to convert the whole of it to DEC first, then send via CAN as BYTES.At the other end I have to recieve the CAN BYTEs, convert to DEC, then back to the ASCII caraters.Cheers,

To convert decimal to ASCII you can also use a pointer.  I have not tried to use a pointer to convert ASCII to decimal but I would imagine it would be the same thing since you are just pointing to a memory location and pulling the data in the type that you need it.
