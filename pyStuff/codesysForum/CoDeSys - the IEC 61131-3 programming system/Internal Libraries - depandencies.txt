Hello Gurus.

Some very basic questions:

Any pointers to documentation for creating internal and external libraries?

a) We want to create a library thats not target-specific, this library is dependant on several 3S CANOpen libraries, wich resides in the specific target-directories.
To get the library to compile, we have to include several libraries by full path, and also declar GLOBAL->CANOpen_Implicit_Variables. Otherwise library compilation fails.
Now if we do this, we automatically declare a global set of variables when the library is included, and we do not want that, since it overwrites the normal CanOpen declaration. How do we write a library using standard SDO/PDO functions without this declaration being included in the library?

b) To work around the problem above I've created a sub-library wich only contains this declaration, wich is then linked in the real library - but when I include the "real" library in a project, the dependencies also includes this sub-lib, wich then has to be removed - this is not the correct way I take it?
How do we control the libraires dependencies - Ie. while editing the internal library?

General hints on how to handle libraries dependant on functions unsing 'Implicit' variables would be much appreciated. Also any reference to documentation for creation of libraries in all forms.

I can provide you 3S documentation but I am not sure I should post it here.

I would like to get a hold of these also as I am attempting to do the same thing.
