Hello, I search if there is any simple way to change the type of an existing POUI have programmed a SFC as an FB (in order to have it persistent), but now it's getting quite big and I have to change the code from FB to PRG.Is there anyway to export the code from my FB module to a PRG ? (it is very simple with a text FB just copy and paste in a PRG), but I don't know how to do it with a SFC POU.thank you very muchJacques

yes you can copy paste your SFC, select all you want except the init, and the jumpwith shift.watch the inputs and outputs as this is impossible in a program, and other vars and actions.however better is to have subfunction blocks when it grows too big, just have another SFC called by your first SFC.
