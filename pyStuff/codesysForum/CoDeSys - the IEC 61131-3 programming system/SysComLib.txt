Hello,

Is there a way to find out the physical addressing correlation between COM1, COM2, COM3…COM8 used in the SysComLib library?  Is there a reference I can use?

Kind regards,
Doug

SysComLib is external system library. It implemented inside runtime system by OEM, absolutely different for different controllers. So there is no common (platform independent) method to get physical addressing. You have to ask the controller manufacturer, if you really need to know the chip, electrical scheme and the address.
