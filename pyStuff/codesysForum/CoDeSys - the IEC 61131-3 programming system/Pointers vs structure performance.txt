Hi, what the better way in term of performance when we have 1 FB Master and n FB Slave and we need exchange information between them.1) Create a struture and pass it with a VAR_IN_OUT to master and slave FB2) Create a pointer parameter to master  in the FB slaveThanks in advance.

var in out means you will have a bigger structure.better one structure for out and another for Input.see www.oscat.de for functions to do communications.

If you just compare the performance of data-transport then both methods are same, also the VAR_IN_OUT is a pointer to the data. With using the VAR_IN_OUT the compiler can checke if there is data connected, if the connected data type is correct, and there is absolutely no risk of pointing to wrong data (caused by a onlinechange).So my favorite is : VAR_IN_OUTIf you where asking the same question in the V3 Forum you got more options (References + Interfaces) Which are defenitly also good ways to transfer "large" amounts of data with a good performance.RegardsRalph
