hello,when I bulid a program given by 'codesys 2.3 basic manul',there were seven errors all about global variables.but I was following manul's example ,and the first time I bulit ,it was successful. then I changed something and restore this program , nothing different form the example in book. below are global variables and error messages ,please help me finding reasons.VAR_GLOBAL	IN  AT%IX0.0:BOOL;	L1_GREEN AT%QX0.0:BOOL;	L1_YELLOW AT %QX0.1:BOOL;	L1_RED AT %QX0.2:BOOL;	L2_GREEN AT %QX0.4:BOOL;	L2_YELLOW AT %QX0.5:BOOL;             L2_RED AT %QX0.6:BOOL;END_VARError 3728:Global_Variables(3):invalid address'%IX0.0'Error 3728:Global_Variables(4):invalid address'%QX0.0'Error 3728:Global_Variables(5):invalid address'%QX0.1'Error 3728:Global_Variables(6):invalid address'%QX0.2'Error 3728:Global_Variables(7):invalid address'%QX0.3'Error 3728:Global_Variables(8):invalid address'%QX0.4'Error 3728:Global_Variables(9):invalid address'%QX0.5'

there must be a space in between the AT and the rest.You must have a PLC type declared as it is calculating the address.I do not get this error so please send the complete program.Did you put these vars in the correct place resources-globalvars-globalvars?Not in any other place ie in your PLC_PRG this will not work.the example on the traffic lights is no good example.try for yourself and have a look at www.oscat.de for a nice library.if you look into the TXT version you can see exact how it is programmed.
