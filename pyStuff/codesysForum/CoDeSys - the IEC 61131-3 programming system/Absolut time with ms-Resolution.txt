Hello
I would like to timestamp my values with a time value that has milli second resolution (~accuracy) and transmit them via Modbus/TCP. Now I found the SysLibTime.lib with its structure SystemTimeDate. SystemTimeDate contains the value Millisecond but it seems that this value is always zero! 
There is a timer with micro second resolution, but I can't figure out how to use this counter for mi absolute timestamp. Any help is welcome!
 
PS: I use the WAGO 841 Ethernet Controller.
