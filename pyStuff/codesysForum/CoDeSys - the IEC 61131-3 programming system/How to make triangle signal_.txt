Hi, I'm still new in codesys. I'm doing a project and I would like to have a triangle signal as an output in real number. The inputs are the periode and amplitude. I already try using GEN block with TRIANGLE_POS as the mode, but the output doesn't look good. I also try using INTEGRAL block by changing the IN with positive and negative number, but I can't set the periode. Should I use timer or make a new function or function block to create the triangle signal? I already try that too, but doesn't work well either. Please give me a clue, how to make it possible.

Thanx

Hello

Please look at the example project enclosed. I hope you searched for something like that. I also used the GEN function block.

Bye, Frank Hailer
