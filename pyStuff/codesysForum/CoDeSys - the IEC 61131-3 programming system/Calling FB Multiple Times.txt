I am trying to help someone troubleshoot a system and noticed that they have the same instance of a function block called 3 times in a ladder diagram  POU.  

Are their any inherent problems with doing this?  I have always called a FB only once and changed the input variables as required to do what I needed.  

This is also in a POU with a pretty fast cyclic call rate.

Thanks,

The code inside the FB is execute 3 times in this case. But there is no general problem in doing this.
Sometimes it is senseful to call the same instance twice during a PLC cycle. But mostly it is simply a fault of the programmer who didn't understand the idea of building instances.
