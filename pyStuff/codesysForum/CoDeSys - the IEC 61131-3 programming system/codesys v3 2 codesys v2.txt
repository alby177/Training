Hi allIs there anyway 2 convert v3 2 v2?I need it very badlyRegardssarath

The projects of CODESYS V3 are not downward compatible. But you can copy & paste the ST code between both versions. At least in case you have not used the OOP features - they will definitely not work.But of course CODESYS V2 projects can be easily imported into CODESYS V3.

Thanks for the reply

when you copy and paste them it will be fine, you can also try to export the files, and make some adjustments in the EXP file (XML text)Most library functions will not work, and if needed i can help you with the translation
