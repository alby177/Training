Hi!I'm new to this forum, and quite new to Codesys as well. I have many years of experience programming Siemens S7, Allen-Bradley, and some Mitsubishi and Omron.And I'm really starting to like Codesys and the the way things are done. I like the pointers and that I can create a FB with array of n size, like it's done in the oscat library.But to the point:I have a project where I want to use 750-881 with 750-464 fra Wago. And in the manual for 750-464, in chapter "6.2 Setting Parameters via Parameter Channels", there is talk of some methods for configuring the card via control/status-byte or 2-byte process data interface (SPS interface).Setting up the various cards from PLC code is something I have done in both Allen-Bradley and Siemens.But I don't understand the manual, I think it's a bit vague. So now I'm hoping some of you guys may point me in the right direction.Link to the english manual for 750-464: http://www.wago.com/wagoweb/documentation/750/eng_manu/modules/m07500464_xxxxxxxx_0en.pdf
