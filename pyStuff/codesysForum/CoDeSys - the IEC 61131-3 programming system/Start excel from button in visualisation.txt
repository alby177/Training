Hi there, 
I need to start excel from a button in the visualisation or run a batch file from another button.  I have looked at using the program feature of a button but it doesnt seem to run a batch file when pressed.

I have also tried the function _ and not had luck with this can any one help with this command.

Thanks, Russell

Hi,

I just tried it myself. In fact it is quite simple:

Insert e.g. a rectangular box in the visualization, double click on it, choose the category "Input", activate "Execute program" and copy your link into the text box.

In fact it seems that Excel needs to have the link in quotation marks.

Please find an example attached.
