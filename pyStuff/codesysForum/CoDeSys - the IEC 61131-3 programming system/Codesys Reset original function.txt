Hi I am looking for a program or procedure to reset retain memory in Wago unit 750-880.this unit can update the application program at boot with a SD-card.updating this way does not reset the retain/persistent values allready in the PLC.so if the new program has different organisation of retain/persistent variables or are a totally new program the update will fail.existing retain data is corrupted.then the only possible way to get the PLC to run the new program/or update is to do it online with codesys. online - Reset (cold) or Reset (original).for me this is wery problematic.  I send updates by email to customer and she/he copy the backup to the SD-card and boot the unit.no high tech equipment or setup, just normal user computer knowledge.has anyone a solution to this, resetting this memory in PLC?

there is a button behind the small cover for the programming cable, this switch has several functions.it is called operating mode switch.instruct to switch down to bottom and then push the button. this causes a hardware reset (this can be detected by your program, and then you can reset some markers you want, (probably you do not want to reset all (like hourcounter should not be reset).
