Hi,At first i have create an external libary with FUNCTION BLOCK.I am using  "Codesys SP RTE target system"I have some problems to implement my C function (via Visual c++) in Codesy 2.3.Normally when I have created Visaul C++ project at the end I have Biuld it.After Build there are two errors.MSVCRTD.lib(crtexe.obj) : error LNK2019: unresolved external symbol _main referenced in function ___tmainCRTStartup1>C:\Documents and Settings\lsk-ad\My Documents\Visual Studio 2008\Projects\SOME_FUNCTION\Debug\SOME_FUNCTION.exe : fatal error LNK1120: 1 unresolved externalsBut when i Compile it, There is No error. As concerning to manual, I have copy both <library>.obj (visual c++) and  <library>.Lib in Library directory. If i add them in a project; But it does not work. I have no problem to Codesys and I can also build the Codesys Project. but Only External library has no output. I have done all configuration as like "Creating & linking External C library functions" manual in Visual C++.ThanksasifStill I can not also understand what is Module  RtsCts.C ? And It is important to Use this portion at the End of <Library>. C  part in Visual c++ .static ExtRef CstExtRefTable[] = { /*{Function-name (max. 31 chars), Function-pointer}*/   {"Dummy", (void (*)())CstDummy},  {"", NULL} };ExtRef* CstGetExtRefTable(void) { return CstExtRefTable; }But already try it with my function name but same library has no output Please give me suggestion how i can fix this problem or whats the procedure.Still i am trying.
