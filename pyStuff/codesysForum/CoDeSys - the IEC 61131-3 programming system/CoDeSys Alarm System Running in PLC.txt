I have just configured the CoDeSys alarm system to run on a Moeller XC200 and it seems to be working more or less correctly. The only thing that I can not get to work is the email function.

When an alarm with email triggers, one of two things happens:

1. If I am 'Online' to the PLC at the time, CoDeSys tries to start a mail client on the PC. I dont have mail on this PC so it fails.

2. If not 'Online', the alarm is indicated via a lamp/sounder and an entry is saved to the log file but no email is sent. no errors appear in the event or error lists.

I can send emails from the PLC using the sysMail.lib so I am certain that Internet access and the mail server are OK.

Any ideas ???

Hi,

I have manage to get the alarm logging using visualization. I would appreciate if you could share how do you perform the data logging at your controller.

Also how do we check if the running alarm logging in PLC is possible? Any list  of compatible PLC?
