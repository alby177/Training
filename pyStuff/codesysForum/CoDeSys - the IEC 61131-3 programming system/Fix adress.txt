Is it possible to fix the address of each element of a structure ?
Something like this:

TYPE MyStruct :
STRUCT
 B1: BOOL;
 B2: BOOL; 
END_STRUCT
END_TYPE

MyVar AT [%IX0.0, %IX0.1]: MyStruct;

Thanks.

No. for various reasons all components of a structure must be located in a sequence.

A related feature 3S implemented is Var_Config. It allows to put local variables of function block instances to different I/O locations.
please have a look at [size=18]Variable Configuration[/size] in the Online help.
