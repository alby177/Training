Is it possible to Cast or type convert and Enumeration to a BYTE, as the ECU I am working on is 16-bit so I would assume the default type is WORD.

The reason behind this is to simplify the reading of my application to others as the BYTE in question has fixed constant values.

Just use WORD_TO_BYTE(enum)
