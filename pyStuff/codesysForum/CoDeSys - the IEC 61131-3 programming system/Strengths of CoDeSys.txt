Hi, somebody could tell me what are the strengths of CoDeSys being compared with another branchs like RSLogix 5000 or Microwin? or maybe could send me a web link where this topic is explained.

Thanks

Hi,

we have prepared a power point presentation for that topic which I will send you via email. Of course this is coming from the manufacturer of CoDeSys. I hope you will find some more arguments here from other CoDeSys users   . Anyway - there are lot of points ...

Hi,

I see that this topic is rather old, but I think that here is the place for my question. I need a comparison between different IDEs for PLC. I know CoDeSys quite well, because I use it several years, but I don't know too much for the other existing IDEs. I need this comparison, because I make a PhD work and everything is based on CoDeSys. I have to prove why I choose it. Can you help me? The mentioned above presentation maybe is useful for me. Can I get it?

Thank you in advance!

Dear Roland Wagner ,
