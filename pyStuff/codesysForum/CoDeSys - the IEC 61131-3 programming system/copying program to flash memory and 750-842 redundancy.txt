Hi,I have a redundant setup with two 750-842's communicating tcp/ip via modbusmaster udp FB with a 750-352 dumb i/o setup.1) I have wired connections between the 842's so that if the primary PLC fails, the backup receives an input and takes over.  Is there an easy way/FB available that would allow me to skip the main body of the program as long as the primary PLC is OK?The redundancy requirements do not require the PLC's be synced.  I believe the term is a "Master Relay Function" where the program would simply be idle until it is called to take over.  2) When I lose power to my controller, the program is erased.  How do I use Codesys 3.2 to write the program to flash memory?Thanks,Jason

1) use event in resources task2) make it boot (be sure the switch is correct position under the small lid.
