I added a library to the directory of the Wago 32bit target files and opened it. 

Immediatly I got the error: The Licencing manager could not be loaded.

The project also refuses to compile.

The loaded library is: Enocean_04.lib downloaded from the Wago website.

The library is free of charge, but somehow I need to use the licencing manager which does not start.

Please help me as I need to make a simple program by monday.

It is solved by changing the rights of the user over the C:/LM.DAT folder from read only to Read-Write-delete
