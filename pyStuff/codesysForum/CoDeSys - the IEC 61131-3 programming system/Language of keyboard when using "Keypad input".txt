Hello,

Is it possible to choose which keyboard language that should be used when using the "keypad input" function? The device I'm currently using displays a german keyboard. And even though it's not that big a deal it would be nice to have Y and Z in the "right" places  

Best regards,

I'm also wondering about this. I want to use a US keyboard layout. Why force everyone to use German keyboards on their HMI?

ok roland this is a good one to have a look into.
