see the sample as draw in page 3-3.
a "off" at last. (Network 0004)
when I input the "off"
CoDeSys open a Dialog "Declare Variable"
ask me to input some info....
but I can't find any description in the Guide (about the word "off")
there are 1 error(s) and 1warning(s) when compile

how can I continue the sample...??
