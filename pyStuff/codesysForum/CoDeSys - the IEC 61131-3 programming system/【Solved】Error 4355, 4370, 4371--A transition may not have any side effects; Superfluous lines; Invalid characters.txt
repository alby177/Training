Software: CoDeSys V2.3Function to achieve: control the traffic lightsProblem: The POU PLC_PRG is written in SFC using IEC-Steps. There are three compiling errors which I cannot eliminate even though the help documents contain corresponding explainations.at Transition T002, Error 4355: A transition may not have any side effects (Assignments, FB-Calls etc.)in line 3 at Transition T002,Error 4370: PLC_PRG (3): Superfluous lines found after correct IL-transition.in line 1 at Transition T001,Error 4371: Transition T001 (1): Invalid characters following valid expression: 'T001 := START;"T001T001 := START;T002ST  TON_2.INLD  T#8SST  TON_2.PTCAL  TON_2LD  TON_2.QST  T002Some clues:In the help docs of CoDeSys V2.3, A transition condition must have the value TRUE or FALSE. Thus it can consist of either a boolean variable, a boolean address or a boolean constant. It can also contain a series of instructions having a boolean result, either in ST syntax (e.g. (i<= 100) AND b) or in any language desired (see 'Extras' '_ Action/Transition'). But a transition may not contain programs, function blocks or assignments! In the help docs of CoDeSys V3.5, CODESYS Development System > Reference, Programming > Programming Languages and their Editors > . Sequential Function Chart (SFC) > Elements > SFC Elements 'Step' and 'Transition' As opposed to CoDeSys V2.3, now CODESYS treats a transition condition like a method call. The entry has the following syntax:<transition name>:=<transition condition>(for example trans1:= a=100)or only<transition condition>(for example a=100)
