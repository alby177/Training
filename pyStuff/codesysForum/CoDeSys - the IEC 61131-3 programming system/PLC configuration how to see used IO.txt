Hi I need to know what IO in PLC configuration are effectvely used by a tag or variable in the project. How to do this with codesys V 2.3.9 ? If the programmer hasn't assigned variable name to the IO I imagine there isn't a way to know  the total used and free IO channels of a device in IO bus....

under resources you can find the configuration, here should be a list of used i/oyou can also export this check the global vars as i/o are always global.if they are in the POU declared, you will have to make a list yourself.if you export the program and all POU you can easy search them with an external editor.internal also ctrl F with simple %I and %Q
