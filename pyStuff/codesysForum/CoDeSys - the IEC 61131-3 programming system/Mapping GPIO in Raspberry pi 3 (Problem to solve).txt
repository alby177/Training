Hello,i just burned a new Raspberry Pi 3 because i put output with ouput, so before i do any thing else i must know what im doing.it's very hard to undestand the Mapping GPIO in Codesys for Raspberry Pi 3, what meanse Bits 0-31? Is that a register? I have looked on the Datasheet there is no trace of such mapping.Please share with me you experience how to connect/convert GPIO presentation in Codesys to standard GPIO.(See Screenshots in Attachments)Thank you and best regards.

Hi,hm.. did you ever open one ogf the example projects? In this case the following Project should help:"c:\Users\<YourWindowsUserName>\CODESYS Control for Raspberry PI\3.5.11.10\Examples\GPIO.project" BREdwin

Hey, thank you for your replyYes of course but i still could not understand the schema, in my project for example i used QX0.0-4 (not important which one) what's the equivalant GPIO on the image that you sent?Thank you

If I don't need to use QX and IX what i should use alternative for GPIO?
