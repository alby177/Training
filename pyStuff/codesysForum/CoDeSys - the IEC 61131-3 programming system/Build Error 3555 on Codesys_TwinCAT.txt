Hi!

I got a build error when I made a PRG with a IN_OUT var and of course put it in a task. 
There is no problem useing a IN var, I have even seen it recomended here on the codesys forum.

Why would this not be allowed?

probably your type of program is wrong.
in_out can be used in blocks and subs not in prg.

Hi Shooter!

Yes you can use IN_OUT in PRG, I just did.

What I suppose to do was to have a INPUT(PRG), a MAIN(PRG) and OUTPUT(PRG). And then like a tunnel use a IN_OUT (struct) between MAIN and INPUT and OUTPUT. I placed all the programs in a standard task.

Here is where a made the wrong. If I only use MAIN in the task it works and in MAIN, I call up the input and output program with the IN_OUT structure.
