HelloGot a word containing a decimal number which refers to some modbus registers on another plc.I'm aware I can use unpack for the first 8 byte, but what about those comming after?

check oscat.de for a nice bundle of functions.

I recently needed to do something similar to what you are doing now. I checked the Oscat libraries, but ended up writing my own FB. However, I was shifting an array, not a register. You will most likely need to write your own function block using either BSR/BSL or the rotate command (ROL and another one, I think).

probably you mean bits instead of bytes.you can use a word breaker (makes 2 bytes out of it, or you can use the wordvariable.0 etc.

MYWORD at %MW0:WORD;Then assign variable names to each bit within %MW0. MYWORD_BIT_00 at %MX0.0:Bool;MYWORD_BIT_01 at %MX0.1:Bool;etc.Then each bit of your word is accessible and visible.
