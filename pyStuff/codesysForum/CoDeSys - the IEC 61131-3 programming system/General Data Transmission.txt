Hi all,I would like to send some basic production data directly from the PLC using an ethernet router which has a fixed IP sim card.I have been reading on a few different methods.DDE looks like a possibility, but I am under the impression that we require a local PC at the machine???OPC I know nothing about.Emailing using the alarm function also looks like a possibility.Can anyone think of any other ideas or give me some idea of how I would implement one of these?I am using an ABB Codesys 2.3 PM581I also have another router with fixed IP if this helps.

For DDE you will need to run the Codesys program on your receiving computer.For OPC you only need a small driver which translates the data to a format readable by the receiver for example excel or open office calc.

Thanks for that shooter. I will look at OPC.No doubt I will have lots of questions on this, but I will trawl the forum and read any relevant manuals first.Thanks again.
