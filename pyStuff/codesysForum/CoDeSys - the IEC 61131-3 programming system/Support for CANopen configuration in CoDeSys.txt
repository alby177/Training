Hi,I am completely new in CodeSys 2.3 and I am using PCI-card (Peak-system) with Codesys RTE as master node.I have an actuator motor canopen DSP402.But I dont understand how I start to configure canopen Node DSP 402 actuator in codeSys.I am already save EDS file in  C:\Program Files\Common Files\CAA-Targets\3S\PLCConf_NTRTand now it is showing in PLC configuration under CANmaster-in append Subelemnt (EncoTrive(EDS)). But i cant understand how i go forward.I do not get that I have to configure first send PDO or Receive PDO or SDO.I know I am in very initial stage of canopen configuration but unfortunate I am new   .Can you tell me how can I go step by step to configure DSP402 node?Thanks,Asif

Hi Asif,as far as CoDeSys offers an EncoTrive motor (this mark is used by TR Systems), you can download the operating manual from http://www.tr-electronic.de/trgroup/jsp/ShowDocument.jsp?docnr=TR-EMO-BA-DGB-0010.The manual is in German and English; the English part starts half of the document. It describes the CANopen communication pretty well, then you will understand how it works. Since the CAN communication objects are standardized, the manual is good for any other device of DPS402 type too.Sorry, but I'm not familiar with Peak system PCI cards. Maybe, somebody else can help on configuration.Rolf

Hi Rolf & others,The manual of Tr-Electronics is nice and i have read carefully and now i can start my Actuator DSP402 via Peak-system PCAN-PCI card and I can undersatnd how to work State machine like my EncoTrive DSp402 but Codesys told me that I have to use RTIOwdmPCAN interface and i have also installed that.But problem is, I can not understand how to use this control word in Codesys for IEC programming. Actually via PCAN-view i can operate the actuator motor giving HEX code command but in IEC programing,i have no idea how to use this control world after including EDS file in Codesys RTE Target system.I am really looking forward you all. I think,i am very beginner level.........Thanking by,Asif
