Here are 2 different ways to access the output variable of a FB. It looks similar but it seems that the 2nd one cause crash.
I had the problem with REAL variables. It is Ok with the 1st method.
I am using the Coldfire compiler.
Is the 2nd way correct? 

Code:MyFunctionBlock(VarInput1:='aa', VarInput2:=22, VarOutput1=>LocalVar1, VarOutput2=>LocalVar2);IF LocalVar1 THEN  x := LocalVar2 * 3;  ...END_IF...Code:MyFunctionBlock(VarInput1:='aa', VarInput2:=22);IF MyFunctionBlock.VarOutput1 THEN  x := MyFunctionBlock.VarOutput2 * 3;  ...END_IF...

Both codes look correct and should be possible. Did you check your project by changing the Target to another type of PLC PLCWinNT for example?

This problem has been fixed with CoDeSys 2.3.9.0
Thanks
