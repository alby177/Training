What if the data changed on both sides and comms was down or the message not received? How do you know whether it was changed locally or remotely?Usually you declare the variable list as persistent and if your PLC has the capability it will hold the value. If not, like with the raspberry pi, you'll have to save to file.Sent from my SM-G935F using Tapatalk
