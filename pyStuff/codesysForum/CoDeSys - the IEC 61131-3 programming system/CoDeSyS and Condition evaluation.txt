Hi, I'm asking something about condition evaluation. Check the following code:

Code:var_a := FALSE;var_b := FALSE;if var_a and var_b thenbegin;//Some codeend;

In this case, did the program will check the var_b or it will bypass directly after checking the var_a value ?

If (condition) then
logic
end_if

Your condition is an AND statement which must take two operators A and B. B is never skipped.

the example is not correct but the question is.
when it is an OR does it stop testing the rest?
probably not.

Oh, now I understand. The question is since it was an AND condition and the first vlaue is false that means why even evaluate the second. Missed that one.
