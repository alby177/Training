Hello Everybody,

I am using Codesys 2.3.7.2(Build Dec 15 2006);

and my hardware is PM571 and if the COM1 is configured for CS31 and COM2 is configured for Modbus (Master or Slave) I am unable to use the COM1 or COM2 for program down-loading !
As per PPT file this condition is called "Emergency mode" and what is to be followed to do the down-load is tried like pressing RUN button pressed at the power-up of CPU and followed the steps explained but no success.

Have anybody tried this or can anybody help in this regard.


Best regards
