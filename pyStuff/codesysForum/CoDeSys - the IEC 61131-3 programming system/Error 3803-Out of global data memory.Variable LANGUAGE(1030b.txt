Dear Sir,I have justed added the library OSCAT3.11  and we get the error message above when compiling.Can anybody please advise on how we can overcome this error.Regards,

open the library from file open and do not use a pro but a lib.the make changes and take out lots of function blocks you do not need.mostly a block is asking for another block or function so as oscat is build with sub and subs from subs.look also at the TXT version. it is very educative.if only one small or even one function block is needed take the txt version and copy and paste it in your program. you will get errors just look what else has to be copied and carry on.

Dear Sir,Thanks very much.Method 1 works well. I was first getting 'max number of POU exceeded' until I applied a target settings, then OK.Nevertheless I can't understand why -even if I see that POUs number is less than 100 -I still get the above error (maximum 512 excdd)Method 2 - I copied the block, then two small blocks that are also needed. I cannot figure out well whether to copy into a IL or ST.I copied the main block into ST because it is metioned in the TXT lib. the two small blocks - not specified if IL or ST. I get some errors here.Rgds.shooter wrote:open the library from file open and do not use a pro but a lib.the make changes and take out lots of function blocks you do not need.mostly a block is asking for another block or function so as oscat is build with sub and subs from subs.look also at the TXT version. it is very educative.if only one small or even one function block is needed take the txt version and copy and paste it in your program. you will get errors just look what else has to be copied and carry on.
