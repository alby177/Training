I have loaded CoDeSys 2.3.6.3, supplied by the OEM, onto a laptop that
already had 'IndraLogic' (also supplied by a different OEM).
In CoDeSys 2.3.6.3, the 'Create Boot Project' line, under ONLINE, is
not available to be 'clicked'.

We then took the same CoDeSys 2.3.6.3 supplied by the OEM, and loaded
it onto a laptop that did NOT have Indralogic already installed, and the
Create Boot Project option is available, and does create and download
the boot project.

Any clues to the cause of this?

Not an answer but I have both the Moeller version of CoDeSys and Indralogic on my laptop and I do not have this problem.
