Hello CoDeSys experts,
I know that it is possible to set some options to setup.exe (I use CoDeSys V2.3.9.11) for example for selection of English language - setup.exe /L:0009. I need to know which other option are available, because I start the CoDeSys installer from my own installer. I need a better control on the installation. If somebody has a list with the options, It will be wonderful to show it. It is also interesting can I get some information from Setup.exe if the installation was successful or not. Help me, please...

Good question:

You can change some of the INI files to suit your needs 
3SSetupConfig.ini
Setup.ini

also you can control other installs with a batch file that CoDeSys will run in folder Addition. I think it will run any file with the .bat extension. Don't quote me on that.

I looked through the 3S document and when it gets to "Setup" the documentation is stated as OEM only not end user so if you are an OEM you should be able to request it from 3S.
