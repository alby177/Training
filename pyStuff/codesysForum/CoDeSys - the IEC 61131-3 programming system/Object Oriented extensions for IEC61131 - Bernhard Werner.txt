Did anyone read this article from Bernhard Werner posted on the 3S Home web site? Great article.

It seems there is a mistake in the article in figure 4 code. it was defined :

Code:Var MyRoom1 : LightRoom; MyRoom2 : LightRoom; MyRoomCtrl : ROOM_CTRL;end_varI believe it should be:Code:Var MyRoom1 : LightRoom; MyRoom2 : Light2Room; MyRoomCtrl : ROOM_CTRL;end_var

What do you think? In the example in figure 4 the outcome of calling MyRoomCtrl would have been the same with Room1 and Room2. The inheritance and polymorphism was skipped by not declaring Room2 as Light2Room. If have that wrong please explain.

I believe you are right. Both rooms implement the same interface ROOM, but off course the objective was to show that 2 different rooms can be declared and used as input for the ROOM_CTRL Function Block.
