I want to know which WinCE version (4.x, 5.x, 6.x) is suitable for a typical PLC platform using CoDeSys Ver 3.x and Intel Xscale 400MHz processor?
I heard that there are lots of OS related issues (file handling, task switching, schedular execution time) etc in older versions.

Does anyone have such varied experience and observations on WinCE versions?
In one of my projects I found that WinCE 6.x is faster in schedular and task switching than WinCE 4.x. Is this the observation by others too?

Does WinCE 6.0x support real time multitasking? If not what is the wayout? I need it to minimize the jitter in the task execution time.
