Hello, I saw in an older question, there was online documentation about the code coverage in German.Does something exist in English for Codesys2.3?I would need yor help to answer to those questions, I'm want to qualify codesys for the develpment we are doing (IFM safety module).-	Can Codesys or its use introduce a fault?-	Can Codesys or its use fail to detect a fault?-	Is there a list of known bug in Codesys?-	Is there any built-in tool to perform code coverage in Codesys2.3?-	What are the proves  that Codesys is suitable for SIL2 development?-	What will be the cost of Codesys safety extension?-	What does Codesys team do to verify bug fixes? Thanks in advance for your help, Kind regards, Julien
