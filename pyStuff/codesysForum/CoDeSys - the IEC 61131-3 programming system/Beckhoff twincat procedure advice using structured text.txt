Hi, i'm relatively new to Twincat but not structured text. Can anyone help me in approach to build a project in twincat using structured text?? i need help with general setup of a project e.g. hardware address configuration in twincat and then using structured text to locate these addresses. then use them through my code.Stu

go to the left bottom and find resources (4)then use plc configuration.here you can put the hardware in.when doubleclick on an address you can give it a global name.you can also do this in the VAR list on top of screen, by using %IX0.0 for binary input 0switch to table and it is easier as you just fill a table instead of using : and . and ;a analog word is %IW0outputs are %QW0 and %QX0.0markers are %MW0
