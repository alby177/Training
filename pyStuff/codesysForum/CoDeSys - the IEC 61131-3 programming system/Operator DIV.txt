Some months ago I had this working just fine!
Suddenly have developed amnesia on how to use the DIV Operator and end up with a decimal number.

As in 32767/32767=1
        32767/22222=1.474529
        22222/32767=.6781823
I have tried every combination of data type: INT, WORD, REAL you name it.
I can only ever end up with a 1 or a 0.

IN1 and IN2 are Presently WORD at %IW0 and %IW2

Can anyone refresh my memory?

Hi,

try this.

Code:FUNCTION DIVI : REALVAR_INPUT  IN1: WORD;  IN2: WORD;END_VARVAREND_VARDIVI := WORD_TO_REAL(IN1) / WORD_TO_REAL(IN2);

regards Nitro

Thank you for the quick reply.

Issue is solved.

I had declared  IN1   AT %IW0: REAL;  

Went over this 100 times. Turns out I had a corrupt
version.

Started a new one, everything's fine.
