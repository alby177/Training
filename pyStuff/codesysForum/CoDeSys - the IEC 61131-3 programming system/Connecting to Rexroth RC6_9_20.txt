Hello!I am trying to etablish a connection to a Rexroth RC6_9_20 with Bodas Design 3.0.17.I want to read out the program from the RC, and save it on my ComputerCould someone please tell me if there is a kind of tutorial here at this forum how to set this up?Here is what I do:File - Open - Open project from PLC - PLC - Target Setting _ RC6-9 20 Standard V1.9 - Interface - Peak PCAN-USB - Devicetype RC4-6/22 - ScanI cannot connect, any ideas what`s wrong?Thanks in advance !Newbe

The project must be saved on the device, otherwise it is impossible to open it.a program is compiled in the PC and send to the PLC as a machinelanguage, so you can not download from the device as a compiled file is unreadable (for the most people)

Thanks for information!

Ok, so I`ve been able to connect to the RC.Used Bodas Service 3.5 to flash an existing HEX. file into the RC, and then downloaded a test program.When opening Bodas design after doing a "rebuild all" I got a message "Not found HEX-File:C:\ xxx\xxxx"Have I done something wrong here?I could go online without problems.....

this is outside the scope of codesys, however have a look at settings if the compiler makes a correct hex file and obvious where it is stored.check the project directory.
