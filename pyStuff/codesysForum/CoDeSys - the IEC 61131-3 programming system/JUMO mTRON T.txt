Just about getting started with JUMO mTRON T system. Iâ€™m well familiar with programming in general and an expert in PLC programming. But I'm new to both CoDeSys and the mTRON T. I have (tried to) made a small PLC application with CoDeSys, just to observe if digital inputs can be read and outputs set by a PLC application. But I'm not getting anywhere. Anyone with experience with the JUMO mTRON T CPU and it's PLC functionality?

first attempt is to make a very simple program to make an output to truevarout1 at %QX0.0:bool:=false;end_varthis is above the linebelow writeout1:=true;try above and revert with comment.
