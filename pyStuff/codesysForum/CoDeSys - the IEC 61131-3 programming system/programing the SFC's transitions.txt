hello,
i have a little problem,when i program a transition in SFC language.
if i write the logic statement on the transition itself everything is all right,
but when i click the transition itself and choose the ladder language then i write the same transition's logic statement it doesn't work ( even if the logic statement is true it doesn't pass to the next step)

please look at the attached project,
in order to make the statement true i used the logic at the step3.

I just tested this with a recent CoDeSys version (2.3.6.0) and seems that there is no problem. Please find the projetc attached.

Unfortunately your project was not attached thus I could not test it.
