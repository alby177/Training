Hi friends,using CoDeSys 2.3.9.28, I have a couple of questions, as follows:1. Is it possible to perform a conditional compilation of code?This means, compile or not compile certain parts of POU's code based on something specified in the project itself, or ideally in an external file.I don't want to compile the same project for different targets or so, target is the same, just to conditionally compile a few lines of code in certain POU's.2. About editors GUIIs there any chance the GUI to remember windows sizes/positions between sessions - after a project close/open? Or at least to set a smaller default size for a new window?I mean imagine an SFC POU and a step in it having an ST entry-action with one line of code. When I double-click "E" in the editor, the action code is opened in a new window which takes approx. 80% of the screen size. Can I do something so that this window appears smaller? If I re-size it, for the current session the window size/position is remembered. But not after a project close/open.This may seem a minor issue, but having to resize and reposition windows all the time is a true productivity killer.I can't find such a thing in the configuration options, but maybe it's possible via some registry or .ini file editing?Thanks

1.yes see compile commands.2.no not possible as far as i can see.

thanks shooter but which compile command you mean? I can't find any related to conditional compilation.Maybe you mean dir lib <libdir> which I guess allows to compile different versions of the same library? If so, I don't want to maintain different versions of librariesSay I have code like this---IF var1 > 5 THEN var2 := 10;END_IF;---and want sometimes to set var2 to 10 conditionally (if var1 > 5), and sometimes unconditionally. To do so I need to conditionally compile lines 1 and 3 - is that possible?

look for the word pragma in the helpfile or in the book.difficult to explain here just play with it.
