Could someone nice post SysLibSockets library(SysLibSockets.lib) example?

Maybe TCP-server and TCP-client..  

Ask at the 3S-support for the TcpUdplib.lib and for an example.

Hello

There's a very useful example project, TcpUdp.pro (enclosed). It includes a TCP Server and Client as well as a UDP Producer and Consumer. The functions within come from the library TcpUdpLib.lib and are modified a little bit.

Bye, Frank Hailer

Hi!

Thanks from example. I got my project working 

Actually I still have one problem. I can reveive messages from my client(LabView-prgoram) to my Codesys-server, but I can't send messages to   Client. I get allways -1 value from Codesys SysSockSend-function. If I check last "TCP/IP API Error Code", I get error "235 Operation would block". Is there problem with socket options, or something else?

Thanks for the TCPUDP example
