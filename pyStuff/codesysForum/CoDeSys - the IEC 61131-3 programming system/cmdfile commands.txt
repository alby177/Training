Hello,

Is there a way to delete an object from a project like it is done for a library?
library delete [<library1> <library2> .. <libraryN>]


Good day,
Yann Papouin.

Hello,
no, its not possible to delete an object with the command-file

 That's not a good news...

I was planning to do a quick script to convert my project to a library by removing some PRG. 

Apparently, the PLC_PRG one is auto removed, I will go with it.
