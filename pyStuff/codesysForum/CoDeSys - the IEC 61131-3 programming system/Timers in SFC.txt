I am trying to monitor the elapsed/remaining time of steps in a SFC program.  Idealy I would like to be able to also change the duration of the step minimum duration.  If this is not possible, how do I implement timers within the step itself, and reset them when the step transition is complete, or on re-entry to the step.


1. Is it possible to access the status of Minimum Time of a non-iec step?
2. Is it possible to modify the Minimum time of a step from the code?
3. If using a timer within a step, what is the best way to reset its state on re-entry to the step?

Thanks.

Hello Geoff.

1. Yes it is find attached a CoDeSys help snipet (Topic Implicit variables in SFC)
2. Use instead of setting a fixed value for Minimum Time a Variable from Type Time (F2 Works inside the dialog) then you get the ability to cange the value. 
3. You mentioned it my way is to set a InputAction and call inside the timer with a FALSE connected to IN.

I hope this helps.
