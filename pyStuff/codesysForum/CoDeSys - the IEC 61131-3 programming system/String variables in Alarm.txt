Hi CODESYS community,I'm programming a machine where different operators can log in. I try to shoot an alarm in the alarm table when a new operator logs in. I tried to use the alarm class "Change" but I dont get it to work, It doesn't triger the alarm when the value changes. Since the name is a STRING variable I've been trying to trigger the alarm with a digital class like: sUser <> sLastUser  It triggers the alarm but when I try to use <TRIGGERVALUE> or <CURRENTVALUE>  it only shows TRUE and not the name of the user. Is it possible to show the STRING name of the operator in the Alarmtable?RegardsSalomon
