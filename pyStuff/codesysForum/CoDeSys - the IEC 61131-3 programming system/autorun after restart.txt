hi

we are trying to set our wago 750-841 modul to autostart program that we load in it, but we have run out of ideas..we cant find any option for it or anything..

our program just starts the lights in room, but when we reset the wago, we have to manualy run the program, but we need it to start automatically without our interference

please help asap!

ps: we are using CoDeSys v2.3

thanx

hello tw0face,

in front of your controller you find a little hinged lid.
Behind this you can find a slide switch.
If you have made a boot project and moved this switch to the
upper position then your program should start automatically after reset.

Uwe

and once again Uwe saves the day 
we were looking only in the codesys app, we thought its some project option 

..thanx!

the switch is a real german thing as siemens has it all have it.
a _ switch to start.
could the plc boys please put the switch as default in the start position. please.
