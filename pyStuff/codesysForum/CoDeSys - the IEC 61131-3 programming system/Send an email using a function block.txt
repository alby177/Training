Hi,Do you know if it is possible to send automatically an email using Codesys?I would like for example my system to warn me by mail when one of my pump is in fault.Thanks,masav

You can use Alarm Configuration (Ressources).Example : send an email when a boolean variable changes state, using SP PLCWinNT.1 - Define variable :VAR_GLOBALB1:BOOL;(*variable must send email*)END_VAR2 - Create a new Alarm Classes called, for example, myalarm.3 - Choose action "Email"4 - Configure Email (by double clicking on Email action) : From : sender email or the PLC's name or what you want !To : You email address (The recipient's address) Subjetc : .... Message : TIME/EXPRESSION:MESSAGE Actual value = VALUE, Server : The address of the mail server5 - Select System and Append Subelement -> Alarm Group6 - Add a new alarmExpression : a variable you want it send email (B1 for example)Type :  DIG=1Class : myalarmMessage : B1 change state7- In the Target Setting, in visualization Tab, select "Alarmhandling in the PLC"8 - Build and Load application into the PLC, and run it !Now when B1=0 or B1=1 your PLC mustsend you an email, with the following text : h:mn:s/B1:B1 change state Actual value = 1.000000 (or 0.0000000)Best regards  

This is very helpful.I have a couple of questions though.Firstly, how can I define variables to be displayed in the message?i.e. what is the syntax for including variables in the message. I would like to send a collection of counter and timer values.Secondly. How do I handle sending an email if my account has a sending password?Thanks for your time.

Hello,I've used this method in CoDeSys V2.3.9 but it seems to have disappeared in V3.5.Does anyone know how to send alarm mails in V3.5.4 SP2 please ?

see oscat.de for a nice library containing this type of communication, separate lib.even in english.
