Hello everyone, i'm using PID_FIXCYCLE just with P and I.I need sometime to disable the I part : if i put TN=0  and i use only TP,  the output of PID remains blocked. Where i'm wrong ?

fix is same as pid however you need to give a time to calculate (that can be different from realtime)if only using P check the PB(or Kp)

Integral effect in the formula is like 1/TN so if you give "0" to TN a math error occur.So if you want to decrease the effect of Integral give bigger value.

math error is not occuring as it is checked in integral. and on other places when using util.libsame for oscat.lib btw.so if set to zero it is discarded.
