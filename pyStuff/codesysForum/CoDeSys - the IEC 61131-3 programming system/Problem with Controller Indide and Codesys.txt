Hi, I have a communication problem between a Controller Inside made by Telemecanique and Codesys software v.2341. The problem is that it won't communicate on the RS232. The parameters were default 38400 baudrate parity:no COM1. If I change the baudrate I get a 33% quality for the first time I try to log, then 0%.

 I will paste below the log file:

##INSPECTOR-LOG-FILE##

##SECTION:HEADER##

I have tried with a bluetooth device and works until the end of transfer, then it disconects with the same network error. This is very strange, no one has worked with controller inside before?

Problem solved, the cable was bad.

Ok now I have other question, altho I can see that no one worked with controller inside programmed by codesys. The controller has 4 words inside a PDO3 package that is sent on canopen as far as I know. What I do not now is the adresses of those 4 words, so I can send informations across the canopen network. Any ideas?
