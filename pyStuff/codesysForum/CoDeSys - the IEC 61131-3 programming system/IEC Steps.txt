I have IEC Steps selected and have a few questions. 1. The "N" action always appears but I can never expand the window to enter my commands. Can this part of the block be expanded to enter code (Can ladder, FB or ST all be used here). 2. Also is there a way to default the Entry and exit actions to always be on and to open in ST.3. Is there any way you can use the mouse to select series and parallel blocks to copy an paste. I only have been able to copy series blocks using the Ctrl left mouse button.

1.Under project you see add actionhere you can put any actions in any language you are using.In the IEC step you can define the qualifier (like N for Normal running when step is active)A P for only once when steps gets active etc.One remark here (the actions are not checked when not active so a timer will have some problems to check)2. No you can not use a default However you can copy a step and its transition and use it many times. You can even make a small lib with this.Do not use IEC steps and NX together as this is hard to read because you have 4 programs running on one step.3. click on the first one (top) then hold shift and click the lowestfor the transitions you should use 1 rung external ladders without coil

Paul,I see how to add actions and I know I can program in any supported language. I am using IEC steps so I should should have an entry action an exit action and an action which runs as long as the step  is active (N action) I think The N comes out of the right side of the step and has two boxes the first says N and the second I can type code in but it does not expand. Is this my step in process code and if so why can I not expand it?

I have written an example codesys and uploaded it, just take this exampleYou have to add actions in your program and then call them via the N (other functions are also possible see qualifier)An Entry action is possible by using a P (Pulse) this is run only once.(from help file In order to associate the actions with IEC steps the following qualifiers are available:N Non-stored The action is active as long as the step R overriding Reset The action is deactivated S Set (Stored) The action is activated and remains active until a Reset L time Limited The action is activated for a certain time, maximum as long as the step is active D time Delayed The action becomes active after a certain time if the step is still active and then it remains active as long as the step is active. P Pulse The action is executed just one time if the step is active SD Stored and time Delayed The action is activated after a certain time and remains active until a Reset DS Delayed and Stored The action is activated after a certain time as long as the step is still active and remains active up to a Reset SL Stored and time limited The action is activated for a certain time The qualifiers L, D, SD, DS and SL need a time value in the TIME constant format. This value can be entered directly (e.g. “T#5s”) or by a variable of datatype TIME (e.g. “t_var”).An EXIT program is more difficult in IEC (I have to check when output is true if all actions are done even when transition is true)The transition is or a Bool out of the action above or just any bool from the global or local another way is to use here a ladder without a output.You only are allowed to write one boolean as output.I saw something peculiar when proramming.Before you even program one step have the iecsfc.lib in the library list and set the IEC steps to ON .It is possible to use the steps but they will never work when other sequence is used.If you send me your PRO or i prefer EXP file i will comment it and send it back to the forum. (or if email given to your PM.
