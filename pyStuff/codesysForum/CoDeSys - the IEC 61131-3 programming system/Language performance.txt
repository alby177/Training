Hi,
I'm wondering if anyone knows if there's any studies on the peroframnce of the IEC 61131-3 languages compared to each other. Is there any penalty for writing in one of the graphical languages as compared to say structured text?
My feeling is that there's none or very little diffrence (at least if the graphical lanauge is used for a task that suits it) but I'm writing a report where CoDeSys is a central part and thus I need to be able to give a reference to a document that states this, or in the case that I'm wrong states something else.

Regards
Leon
