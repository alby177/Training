Hi,
I have a small problem... If i have constructed a FB using FBD i've got problems calling actions in current instance. 
If using ST everyting works perfect but with FBD style the "action box" expects every input of the FB?!?!?!. Is it supposed to be like that.?

Yes, this is the correct way.

Even if you do not need to edit the VAR_INPUTs of the "mother's" FB in order to execute the action, sometimes it might make sense to do it. Therefore they are liste at every call of an action.

But if you do not want to change the inputs, you can leave them without a value. What you have to do is delete the "???" at the inputs you do not want to change. That's all (see attached screen shot).
