I am looking to do some heavy automation of Codesys for our development/publishing workflows and I would really like to use the available COM Interfaces. I do not need to automate program deployment to target PLCs, so the Gateway Server is not going to be very helpful from what I can tell.Is there any documentation on the COM Interfaces for Codesys. I can successfully connect to them, but I am having a difficult time using them correctly, and I can't seem to find ANY literature on them. I didn't even know they existed until I recently stumbled across a single mention of them, but they were never mentioned or explained again.These interfaces do exactly what I need and I would pay a fair sum to get hold of some proper literature. Even if its largely outdated, I think it would still be valuable to me.Thanks for any help.ChadP

After a few hours, I should say that I had NO luck. Im not the best with COM, but I know I should be further than this. I don't think I have had a successful Method call yet. I either get no repsonse, or I am throwing errors.Either this library has a difficult roadmap to use correctly, or else it is no longer functional (but why then would it be included with the installer and registering itself as an Active Component).Upgrading to CoDeSys 3+ is not an option for me yet, so I really need to try and get somewhere with this.
