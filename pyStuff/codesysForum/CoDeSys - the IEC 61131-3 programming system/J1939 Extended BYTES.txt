Hi Guys,I need to send a J1939 message that has 20 BYTES, rather than the standard 8 BYTES.The only FB I can find has 0..1748 BYTES. I Tried this but all the BYTES after 20 I think are causing an issue with false data on the BUS.Normally I would fill unused BYTES with FF (255) but it would take me hours to do this to each individue unused BYTES.Any way to do this simpley?

what FB did you find and did you have a look at oscat library for communication?

Hi,The only function blocks I have come from IFM and they are just CAN_TX or J1939_TX, both limited to 8 BYTES.In the Oscat lib I have, there is no cominications?

oscat has several libs.look on the site

That is an ifm specific function block.  If you are using the J1939_TX_ENH_MULTI you can specify the length of your array as an input the function block.  You still need to declare your array as an array ARRAY [0..1784] OF BYTE but it will only send the length that you set.

Hi,I did try that but when the message was transmitted, it caused issues on the BUS with currupting other messages.I am at IFM Wednesday so will be looking at this and let you know.
