Hello,
a question I have not been able to find the answer for by reading docs alone:

I pass around a block of binary data between the PLC and surrounding Windows PC's. Inside there are a few LREAL floating-point numbers. These can be easily copied into an Intel 8-byte long real, when the sending PLC is Codesys softplc. They are obviously binary compatible.

Could I expect the same trouble-free reception of those data if the sender was a Rexroth L40 PLC, which (probably) has some other kind of non-Intel processor? Yes it can be tested, but I don't have one...

Somebody knows?

Thanks
Jens

I will answer my own question, just for the record: Yes it was compatible. Took a chance on passing the binary data, and yes, it had the same format as windows/intel. Don't know if the IEC standard regulates this or if it was by chance. But it worked.
