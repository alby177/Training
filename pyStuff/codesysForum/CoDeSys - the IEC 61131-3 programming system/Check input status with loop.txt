Hello everybody,I would like to create a loop in codesys which would check DI status and then activate DO. For this experiment I'm using wago 750-831 controller and wago 750-330 bacnet coupler.In my mind it should look like this (I'm puting this example just to show what I have in mind):VAR Input_1,Input_2, Input_3; Output_1, Output_2, Output_3; i:INT;END VARFOR i:=1 TO 3 BY 1DO If Input_i = TRUE THEN;   Output_i = TRUE;ELSE   Output_i:=FALSE;END_IFEND_FORBasicly what I though I could do is to create string variable with CONCAT (varname:=CONCAT('Input_',INT_TO_STRING(i)) and then put it into IF but not as string but as variable name somehow. I couldn't find function or function block that would do that. Is it even posible? I of course could do the whole page of IF and ELSE IF but I would like to use more "beutiful" solution than this. Keep in mind that these variables is phisical DI DO signals and Bacnet variables.

Could you just use an array?Code:VAR    aInput : ARRAY[1..IOMAXSIZE] OF BOOL;    aOutput : ARRAY[1..IOMAXSIZE] OF BOOL;    iCount : INT;END_VARVAR_CONSTANT    IOMAXSIZE : INT := 3;END_VARFOR iCount := 1 TO IOMAXSIZE BY 1 DO    aOutput[iCount] := aInput[iCount];END_FOR

I think I know what you mean but I'm not aware of a way to manipulate variable names dynamically. I have applications like a number of compactors where the IOs are called something like Compactor1_xExtLimit but I have to hand over the IO to a function block call at some point.An array won't help either because then you will have to assign the array element as the IO variable. Same Same but different, same amount of work.Sent from my SM-G935F using Tapatalk
