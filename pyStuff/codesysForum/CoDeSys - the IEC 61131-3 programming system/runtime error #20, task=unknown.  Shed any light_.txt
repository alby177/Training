Hi guys,

Just wanted to know if anyone could shed some light on this matter.  It happens to almost all projects I work with.  The below example is for downloading into a PLC using a USB to Serial converter but I've used ethernet as well and the same problem happens.

You can see from the three screenshots attached what's going on.

In the first, I just go to online->run and after the codes been compiled and downloaded the following message happens (Runtime error #20 (task=unknown) )

It doesn't log me out.  I'm unable to 'run' the program as shown in screenshot two.  However, If i go to 'single cycle' the program starts working.  If i go to 'Run' again I'm able to run it.

So I'm able to download the program onto my PLC but this error just keeps coming up, can anyone shed any light onto it?

Cheers,

Nav

hi nav

put a breakpoint and check line by line then u will come to know where u have the problem
or
please attach the source code i.e. project(.pro file).

thanks for your response.  
after a while of headbanging it turned out to be a hardware configuration causing the problem (an internal coupler wasn't defined).

Cheers,

I realize this was ~4 years ago, but I was wondering if you remember exactly what internal coupler wasn't defined. I keep getting this same error and it is driving me crazy!   I have an ABB AC500 PLC (PM591 CPU w/Internal Ethernet and two DC532 I/O blocks). I have appended the subelements: (2) DC532's and (1) PM5x1-ETH - Internal-Ethernet[SLOT].Am I missing something?
