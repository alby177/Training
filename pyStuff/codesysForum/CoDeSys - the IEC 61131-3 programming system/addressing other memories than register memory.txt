hello

im a new into all this kind of stuff so ill try to explain my problem the best i can. we have a few wago modules so far. and we are developing our own application to work with it. 

our goal is to be able to read anything from the wago itself. i managed to get working the jamod library, so now i can read/write digital/analog registers. this is very good, but what is more, i need to be able to also read (somehow, anyhow) the variables of program running in wago. meaning, that i made a program in codesys, that's measuring temperature for example. i put this value into some retain variable, but dont put it on some register. 

my question is, how can i read the variable in retain memory, i think its a different type of memory then the one u can address like %IX2.0 etc..
as well as any other type of memory thats included in wago modules..

im sure there is a way how u can do this, because codesys itself reads the variable for example from retain memory when u open the program, connect to wago and run it..

well..i hope i made sense 

please i really need your help!

thanx in advance!

Hello tw0face,

i don’t know the jamod library but i think you use modbus TCP.

With modbus you have access for some memory areas.
If you want to get a variable from the plc then you have to place this variable at 
a defined memory address.
Example
VAR
speed   AT%MW0   :    INT;
temp    AT%MW1   :    INT:
END_VAR

Note : 
You have to administrate the used addresses by yourself and 
you have to pay attention for the wordalignment. 

With your jamod library you have access to the %M area from address 12288 (0x3000)  up to
16383 (0x3FFF)  means  %MW0 …%MW4095
