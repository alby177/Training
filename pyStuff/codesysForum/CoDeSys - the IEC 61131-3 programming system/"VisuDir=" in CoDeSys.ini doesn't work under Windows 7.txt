Hi!I have the following problem. I'm using 64-bit version of Windows 7. When I set a path for "Visualization files" from menu "Project/Options/Directories" everything works fine. But when I check the tag "VisuDir=" in CoDeSys.ini it is still empty. It looks that this is not so with other Windows-version (for instance XP). The problem is that I want to set this path from my own installer (outside of CoDeSys). I thought that I can do this if I modify the CoDeSys.ini. So the real question is - can you tell me where CoDeSys stores the path for "Visualization files" under Windows 7? Actually I need a solution that works in all Windows versions. Please, help...
