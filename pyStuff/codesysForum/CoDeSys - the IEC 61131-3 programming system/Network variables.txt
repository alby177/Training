Hello,One question regarding Network Variables. I am using an IFM system with CAN communication.I have a controller and a display. I wan't to change parameters in the controller from my display but am not sure how to configure Network variables. If I configure the variables as both read and  write and retained in "both ends" I would think that things might get confused at restart.Best regards

Has no one ever done this type of setup??????????????

We do not use IFM software but we have done many installlatuins using HMIs with CoDeSys. However, we almost excluesively use Ethernet. The Hmi has a CoDeSys driver.When Building the PLC code, we export the symbol file. When creating the Hmi application we import the symbol file and all tags are available for use in the Hmi. A long time ago we did a CANopen HMI with Moeller but it was very cumbersome and so we decided not to do it again.
