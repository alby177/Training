Is there any standard block in CoDeSys regarding analog conversion to PWM ouput.?
If not where I can get the algorithm for that.

please find attached an example, which i took from a hardware-schematic with NE555 and OPs and "translated" this to FUP as an programming exercise.

Hope this helps.

pls check the oscat opeb source library
which you can download under www.oscat.de
there different pwm blocks to use with source code
