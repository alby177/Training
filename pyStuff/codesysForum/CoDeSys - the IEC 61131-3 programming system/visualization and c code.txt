Hi guys, Im a beginner in codesys. Im a C code programmer.

Im making a serial boat loader for TI ÂµControllers that can automatic program in series.

The original boatloader is in C code. Can I use this code in my codesys project?

Also I want a numeric keypad in my visualization. How I implement this, cause I cant find it in the standard visualization lib?

The project is going to run on a beckhoff CX9000 with CE.

regards,
Jo
