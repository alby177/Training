Hi.

I have some mapping problems from the serial ring buffer.
I use:
Wago plc 850-873
SerComm.lib
Serial_Interface_01.lib
Anyway the comport is working fine with small messages.

My goal is to:
Receive 144 Byte that is placed in an array. (Receive Buffer)
Analyze this, and send 713 Byte.(Send Buffer)

Problem is that the Receive buffer is 255 Byte in the lib i use, and it is just counting round.
Any possibility to addjust the receive and send buffer to exactly fitt my sizes?
