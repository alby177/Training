Hi,I have a weird situation and I can't find how to fix this :I'm writing a program that writes datas measured into a .csv fileThe file is organized like this format : Quote:time_of_measure ; data1 ; data2 ; ... ; dataNWhere :-  I get the time of measure by the function 'SysRtcGetTime' and time is in the format 'DT#2011-08-18-15:47:48'- All my maesures are REAL.First I tried to write the time and values of the measures without changing their types and I got a file with weird symbols such "@'$" , "@Z", etc.So I used DT_TO_STRING and REAL_TO_STRING to change the types to STRING.The time of the measure works perfect BUT ! All my datas look like this :Quote:28.249518-15:47:48     (my data is 28.2495Â°C)So there is a problem with some kind of register interferring with the function REAL_TO_STRING because we can see that my program adds the end of the time value to my data.I'm getting crazy because I can't find a way to have my data and ONLY my data.I can't just write STRING(7) because the next data might come from another sensor and have 10 decimals...Please if you have any idea...Thank You.
