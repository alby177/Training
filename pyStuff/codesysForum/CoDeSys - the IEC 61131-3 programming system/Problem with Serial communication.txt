Hello,

I tried recently to use the SysLibCom library in CoDeSys with that program : 

IF(result=0)
THEN
	PortTest:=SysComOpen(2);

	ParamCom.byParity:=0;
	ParamCom.byStopBits:=1;
	ParamCom.dwBaudRate:=9600;
	ParamCom.dwScan:=0 ;
	ParamCom.dwTimeout:=0;
	ParamCom.Port:=2;
	ParamCom.dwBufferSize:=0;


	result:=SysComSetSettings(PortTest,ADR(ParamCom)) ;
END_IF
b:='BONJOUR';
c:=SysComWrite(PortTest,ADR(b),LEN(b), 100) ;
resultClose:=SysComClose(PortTest);

But it doesn't work : when I try to access the system, it's write "ParamCom.Port:= ***INVALID : 0", but I can run the program normally.

What's the matter here ?

Thanks for your help.

EDIT : I saw that the matter is the handle returns by the SysComOpen functiun.

May i know what hardware are you using for this SysLibCom library ?
