CodeSys v2.3... Is there a way to hide the global variables of an internal library? {library private} does not hide them. Is Access Rights the way to hide them? I would like to distribute this library password protected; and also want the global variables to be hidden.

global variables can not be hidden. as only one long list is available for them.
