Hello,

I've got a question about the function SysResetPlcProgram.
In my application i want to do a plc reset when some plc specific events occour and then do a SysStartPlcProgram. In the help it only says that the reset function creates a task! How do i start the plc when its reset?

Regards

Hasse

Hello Hasse,

A Restart is only possible in the code of the runtime systeme. Such things are typically done in I/O driver. And must be done by the hadrware- manufacturer.

I think this is possible by handling the "after_reset" system event with a callback POU. Something like:

Code:FUNCTION CallbackRestart : DWORDVAR_INPUT   dwEvent : DWORD;   dwFilter : DWORD;   dwSource : DWORD;END_VARVAREND_VARSysStartPlcProgram(0);

After a reset of the POU, the controller will be restarted.

I did something like this with PlcWinNt for handling execptions: I reset the PLC and I restart it. It was Ok
