Hi, Dear all:

when i exported SFC program in project A, then imported it in project B.

After the operation, i found that SFC programs in project B were quite different, funtions were ok,but very difficult to read. 

why like this? Bug in Codesys?

Thanks for all

Alex

it does not keep positions however it does work.
yes you could call this a bug, however when translated all this info will be lost all together.

Once more again! 
Do not export and import! Use Project --> Merge to copy directly form another project. The export format is a simplfied description which contains only the logik.
