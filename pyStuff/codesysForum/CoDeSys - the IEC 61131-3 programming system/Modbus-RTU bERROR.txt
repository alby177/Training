Hi All,I am attempting to communicate between a RedLion touch panel (G308C2) and a Wago 882 via Modbus-RTU.The touch panel is the master and the PLC the slave (via a 750-653 Modbus card).Communications is established using the Wago TerminalSlave.lib library and its TERMINAL_MODBUSSLAVE_RTU function block in CoDesSys.Now to the question   , I have established communications but even with the most trivial of applications I receive an error code from the bERROR output, "INVALID: 204" which I cannot identify in documentation or google.I realise that this a bit obscure but if anyone has any ideas I would appreciate it.Kind regards,Alex.

I take a look at the Wago docs.. just 0-1-2-3 error codes are foreseen..I used same block some months ago with 758 IPC..I used this settings and it was good:RTUClient(	EN:=TRUE ,	bSLAVE_ADDRESS:=104 ,	bCOM_PORT:=2,	cbCOM_BAUDRATE:= 3840,	cpCOM_PARITY:=0 ,	csCOM_STOPBITS:= 1,	cbsCOM_BYTESIZE:=8 ,	cfCOM_FLOW_CONTROL:= 4, (* 0=no flow control; 1=XON-XOFF   2=RTS-CTS  3=full duplex ; 4=half duplex  *)	tTIME_OUT:= ,	iBIT_OFFSET:=,	tWATCHDOG_TIME:= ,	aDATA:=ModbData ,	xWATCHDOG_OK=> ,	bERROR=> );and call this PRG as fast as possible in a dedicate task(freewheeling) otherwise I get comm very bad and slow.. try this...
