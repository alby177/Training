Hi,

It's my first time using CoDeSys and I have to program a Controller Inside for a ATV Drive (Schneider Electric). Refering to the user manual, I have to declare a variable in the Retain memory allocation using VAR_PERSISTENT or VAR_RETAIN. Somethnig doesn't work, because everytime I turn off the power, all retain variables lose their value.

Did I miss something, what I must do ??

Regards,

Hello,
don't know the controller you use. But with Beckhoff, regardless the RETAIN or PERSISTENT declaration of vars, one has to enable retain memory in system settings. Maybe, your controller retain memory also needs to be enabled. Check the target configuration.
Regards
