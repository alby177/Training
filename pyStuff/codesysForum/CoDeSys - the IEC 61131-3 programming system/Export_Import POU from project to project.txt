Hello, I'm creating one personal library, I test each FB in one "progect.pro" and if the FB is OK, I want to add it to a "library.lib".
Is it possible?
At the moment i can't copy/paste nothing that is not a ST, but I want to use also SFC, CFC ect...

no ideas?

Copy and paste via the Windows clipboard works with ST and IL only. For the other languages try to export / import the needed POUs.

Project | Export brings selected POUs into a file, Project | Import imports them into the actual project. This should work with all programming languages.
