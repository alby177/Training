Hello all!

I need to solve a prolem with retains. I have a program with retains using. During compilation I see that all retains go to retain memory. In my controller I can find a file with name retain.bin. But the value of my retain variable is 0. And file retain.bin in my controller is empty but has a size as size of the allocated memory.
Does anybody can help me?

Hello Wizard,

Couldn't you make your magic to work on that?  

We had a problem like yours, with a Kontron IPC.

We had to do the following into RTS3S.CFG file:
MapPhysical0=ShmRetain under [PLC].
And then do a registrysave.

Best regards

Thank you but I have already fixed this problem!
