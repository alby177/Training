Hello communityDo you know whether there is in CDS3 function to get current date and time like it is in CDS2  "SysRtcGetTime" ?I was able to find out just library DTU which has "GetDateAndTime" function block. Unfortunately that FB needs some time to process and makes things little complicated â€¦ .Is there something faster existing?Any help is appreciated.Thank you in advance.Regards,W.

Hello WickedIn my system (WAGO 750-) is also a second functionblock to read the time: CurTimeEx in the lib: SysLibTime.libThis function is (in my case) about six times faster.To get the same data type you have to create a DT# variable.Here the program which is translating the structure of CurTimeEx to DT#The declaration part:PROGRAM ReadClock_CurTimeExVAR	Realtime_extended:(* The realtime as a complex variable *)	Realtime_64:SysTime64;	TimeDate:(* Structure with year, month, etc. *)	Helptime: (* Helper with is collecting the time*)	dtActualTime: DT;END_VARThe code part (in structured text):Realtime_extended	(SystemTime:= Realtime_64 , TimeDate:= TimeDate );Helptime := CONCAT ( 'DT#',UINT_TO_STRING (TimeDate.Year));(* DT#2009 				*)Helptime := CONCAT ( Helptime ,'-');(* DT#2009- 			*)Helptime := CONCAT ( Helptime ,UINT_TO_STRING (TimeDate.Month));(* DT#2009-10 			*)Helptime := CONCAT ( Helptime ,'-');(* DT#2009-10- 			*)Helptime := CONCAT ( Helptime ,UINT_TO_STRING (TimeDate.Day));(* DT#2009-10-30 		*)Helptime := CONCAT ( Helptime ,'-');(* DT#2009-10-30-		*)Helptime := CONCAT ( Helptime ,UINT_TO_STRING (TimeDate.Hour));	(* DT#2009-10-30-23 	*)Helptime := CONCAT ( Helptime ,':');						(* DT#2009-10-30-23:	*)Helptime := CONCAT ( Helptime ,UINT_TO_STRING (TimeDate.Minute));	(* DT#2009-10-30-23:56	*)Helptime := CONCAT ( Helptime ,':');						(* DT#2009-10-30-23:56:	*)Helptime := CONCAT ( Helptime ,UINT_TO_STRING (TimeDate.Second));	(* DT#2009-10-30-23:56:30	*)dtActualTime := STRING_TO_DT (Helptime);Hope this helps,  Eckhard

Thank you!
