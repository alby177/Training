Hiya ppl,

I have TLCC v1030.
Is there any documentation for all its *.LIB files? 

e. g.
TLCC_Standard_V1030.lib
TLCC_SysLib_V1030.lib
TLCC_Check_V1001.lib

Thanks

Hi, 
all the documentaion should be in the installed target area (there should be a directory called help )... if not, please contact the manufacturer.
