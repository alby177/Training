Hello All,I am try to create  3 switch with visualization.  I have there global variables (switch) x1, x2, x3.I am trying to write a program if X1=1, then X2=0 and X3=0. It same for if x2=0, then X1=0 and x3=0. If X3=1 then x2=0, x1=0.I have tried with (If_else) condition but it not works. Then I also use "RS or toggle " funtion block but it is not working.MY intention is X1  is "true " condition untill X2 or X3 is "False" but when press X2 then X2 is "True" and X3 and X1 is off "false".X2 is "true" but after pressing x3, X3 should be" true" and other x2 and x1 is "false".I have written following two function but it is not working.1st trying:  If X1 =true then   (* X1, X2 and X3 are global variable*)X1:=true; X2:=false; X3:=false ; ELSIF  X2=true thenx2:=true; X1:=False; X3:=false;ElSIF  x3=true thenX3:=true; X1:=false; X2:=false;END_IF ;Trying another way:I have also tried with RS or toggle function block:varReset_ablauf_Coil_Auto:RS;Reset_ablauf_Stange_Auto:RS;Reset_ablauf_Stange_Munual:RS;END_varReset_ablauf_Coil_Auto(	SET:=X1 ,	RESET1:= X2 OR X2,	Q1=> X1);Reset_ablauf_Stange_Auto(	SET:=X2 ,	RESET1:= X1 OR  X3,	Q1=> X2);Reset_ablauf_Stange_Munual(	SET:=X3 ,	RESET1:= X1 OR   X2,	Q1=>X3);In my first trying i have some priority problem but second one is also not working.Pls give me suggestion or idea.Best Regards,Asif   

Your problem is not in the code, but you have three switches used as inputs, it is impossible to change the inputs itself.You will have to use another strategy.example:if R_TRIG X1 then status :=1;if R_TRIG X2 then status :=2;etc.now you can see which button is pressed last.CASE status1:do here what you want in status 12:etc.END_CASE
