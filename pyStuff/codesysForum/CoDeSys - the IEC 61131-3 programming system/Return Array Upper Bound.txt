I thought I have done this in the past but can't find the code. Is there a function to return the upper bound to an array dynamically? For instance

MyArray :Array[0..8] of int;

for i := 0 to MAX(MyArray) do
  something
end_for

As long as it returns either the number of elements or the Max index.

Hi Steve,
No there is no way to do that. 

I always use constants to declare arrays and by doing that i get the bounds of the array.

Code:VARMyArray :Array[0..8] of int;END_VARVAR CONSTANTUpperBound: INT:= 8;END_VARfor i := 0 to UpperBound dosomethingend_for

Thanks,

That is how I solved it as well. My situation was I have about 10- 15 small functions that compared and retrieved information out of an array of structures. In the event that I need to shrink or expand the size I didn't want to change 10-15 functions. So I just used a global array index as you noted and all is good. 

Although I will try it can you use a constant to declare an array size?

In other words


Code:Var constant ARRAY_INDEX :INT := 8;end_varvar MyArray [1..ARARY_INDEX] of int;end_var

Ups sorry, thats exacly what i meant! 
Yes you can use constants in declaration to define the array bounds.

Code:VARMyArray :Array[0..UpperBound] of int;END_VARVAR CONSTANTUpperBound: INT:= 8;END_VARfor i := 0 to UpperBound dosomethingend_for
