Do you know if SysLibStr will work in simulation?  Specifically, I am trying to copy a string and it doesn't seem to be working.Thanks,

Nevermind.  Found out that a simple assignment operator would work.

I tried to use SysLibStr in simulation mode and it does not work.   The same program used with the APi Soft PLCWINNT works.
