Dear All,Iam using CoDeSys-V2.3I need a sample program for Temperature profiler.for example:[img]E:\profiler.jpg[img]     for 2 hrs the temperature should reach 300 deg C,next  2 hrs the temperature should maintain 300 deg C, after 4 hrs it should go 600 deg C and program should end.

many ways to make it:try SFCinitblock emptytransition is start buttonblock 1 setpoint:=300transition is a timer TON for two hoursblock 2 other setpointtransition for the time etc.and so ongo back to init is automatic.(can not see the img)ladder diagram is also possibbledo it with steps as you learned in school (oops you are and i am doing your homework?)start and init or step1 and notstep2 coilstep1ton and step1 or step2 and notstep3 coilstep2etcstep1 setpoint:=300step2:=600etc
