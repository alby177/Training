I am getting a string overflow error that I can't track down.

The strange thing is that I copy the string to another location and that location always contains the proper values, I just cannot use the original string variable for any comparisons.  The variable is defined as STRING(8) so it has a fixed length anyway so I can't understand this at all.

When I go online with the PLC (Moeller XC100) and look at the variable definition it says **String Overflow**

I can't find any help on this.

Has anyone seen this before

Thanks,

Maybe  you concatenate some strings in your program to the destination of your defined string?
If it doesn't help please send your program to sia@moeller.net. I will care about your problem.

Program sent.  Thanks for the help

In case anyone is watching this thread, Moeller found the problem.

I had the string(8) defined at marker address %MW0

Had another tag defined at %MW8

The problem is that even though the string is 8 characters long,  it requires 9 characters of memory to account for the null \0 character at the end of the string.  When I was writing to %MW8, I was getting a String Overflow since I was overwriting the last character of the string.

Thanks to Klaus and sia@moeller.net for help on this matter
