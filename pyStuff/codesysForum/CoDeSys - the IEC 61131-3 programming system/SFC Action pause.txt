Hi, I am using SFC as my programming language. Some of my actions are also written in SFC. How can I pause "SFC action" attached to one of the step?Thanks,

what do yu mean by pause? the transition is only done when true.however inside an action you can put a loop when pause is needed go to subaction to stop what you wantyou can also use a separate program to disable an output.
