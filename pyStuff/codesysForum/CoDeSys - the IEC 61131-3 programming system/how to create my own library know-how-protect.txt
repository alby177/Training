thanks shooter.. I tried..but opening a project that include my encrypted-external lib it request password every time.. for example standard.lib no need password to include it into my application and if i try to open it directly from Codesys I cannot see the source code..how do like this?

Someone? how can I create my library similar to Standard.lib? (trying opening standard.lib file I cannot see for source code)

If you made your own library, you can protect it against editing with a password, you can also protect it against using with a password.it are two different things within codesys.As the standard.lib is a compiled library it is impossible to open it.util.lib can be edited (be carefull, with this as it will effect all older projects.so make a copy of it and change the name.another great lib is from oscatif you encrypt it, it will ask this password everytime it is used. due to the encryotion.

Is there no answer about this topic.I'm using SoMachine and at the V3.1 I could do it as using Save Project as Compiled Library section but at the V4.1 I couldn't find the same section.How can I do it?

Good Morning,You have to open Somachine Central=> Save project as=> save project as compiled library.Bye
