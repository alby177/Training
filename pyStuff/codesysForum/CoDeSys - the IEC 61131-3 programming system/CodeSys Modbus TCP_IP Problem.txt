Hi everybody,I would like to communicate ABB RTU211 and ABB AC500 PLC via Modbus TCP/IP, but i could not achive it.I configured RTU211 and linked all digital input status correctly. With third party scan programs (like ModScan32) i can monitore digital input status.Also modScan32 shows me the register address.(For Function 4, register addresses start from 30001)On the PLC side, i use ETH_MOD_MAST function block for ModBus TCP/IP communication, when i tried to read RTU211 input register status with function 4, this function block gives me an error code 12325. As an register adress i tried 1 and 30001 it always gives me same error code.For cross check, i communicate 2 ABB AC500 PLC via Modbus TCP/IP, ETH_MOD_MAST function block works fine at that time.If you have any idea pr experience about this topic, could you please help me?Thanks for your advice!

Hi Titus,Can you try with FnCode 3, I think most of the modbus devices works with function code 3 to read the values
