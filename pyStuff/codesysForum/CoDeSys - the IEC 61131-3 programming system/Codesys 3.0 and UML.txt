I have developed a IEC61131 code generator which generates PLC code from an UML model. The code is generated in *.exp ASCII format and then imported into codesys 2.x or Beckhoff.

In the new codesys 3.0 compiler the exp import option is not available anymore. Is there any possibility to generate code for the codesys 3.0 system?

Will there be an automation interface that I can use?
