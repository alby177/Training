Hi, I'm looking for a tool that parse the project's informations present in a documentation created by codesys 2.3 and generate an excel file  (or database table) to have hardware configuration and for every IO the variable used in the program code (POU). This is necessary because I need a map of used and unused IO in my PLC programs to rewamping (programs have not assigned tags in hardware configuration).Thank you for the reply.

for this i use export, it will give you an xml file.
