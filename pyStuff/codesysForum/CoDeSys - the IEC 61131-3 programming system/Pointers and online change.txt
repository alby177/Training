HiIn the help file there is a warning regarding the pointer content when making online changes. Were can i find more infomation about this subject? I wont to know exactly what the issues might be and how to avoid them."Attention: Online Change might change the contents on addresses. Please regard this when using pointers on addresses !"regardsJohan

if you change a pointer the address is not correct anymore, so you could end up with garbage as usual.
