The project I'm working on was compiling/building perfectly until I started to fiddle with the alarm configuration. After some settings in there I get the following error: "Error 3614: The project does not contain a POU named 'PLC_PRG' (main routine) or a task configuration".Of course I have a POU called PLC_PRG...What can cause this?Cheers

Removed a task in the 'Task Config' I had added. Still don't know why it caused error but anyway.

the compiler first looks in the task configuration, if there is any task in there or has been, the default PLC_PRG will not be active anymore as it is a default.however you can put PLC_PRG in the task list without problems.This is best way when there are several tasks, you can give them a priority and a event to start.plc_prg should be freewheeling however.another way to do this to start the programns in PLC_PRG but you dont have the same possibilities to run like timed or when event happens.
