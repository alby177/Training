Hi All,I am a CoDeSyS V2.3 user and the following error sometimes occurs on my application :#81: Access violation in "Access violation Task=PLC_PRG_TASK".It is obviously related to memory allocation but I wonder if :- a more precise root cause is associated to this error message #81- the overall allocated memory in Targer parameters may be involved (not enough memory allocated)- there is a tool that would help to determine in which part of the application the error occurs (the error does not occur when I run the application step by step !). PLC Browser may help in this case ?Does anybody know ?Thanks for your help.Regards,RET

i have the same problem, does anybody have any hints??Thank you,Efrain

I got the same error message with Error# 151003302, even there is no any explanation about it in help files. maybe codesys programmers do not know what it is. 

Hi Guys,                    Go to online and select show call stack,it shows which part of your code is having problem.Most probably the data type mismatch during can cause this,so check in your programs.  Have a good daySarath
