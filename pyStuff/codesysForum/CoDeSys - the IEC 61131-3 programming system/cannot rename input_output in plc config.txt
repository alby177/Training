did you name any outside contact inside an pou?something like in1 at %IX0.1 :bool;check if anywhere outside the global something is addressed.or double address.check all names for allowance like no spaces not starting with numbers etc.check for double namescopy project and delete all cards and check if this is working, then you can check all the names.
