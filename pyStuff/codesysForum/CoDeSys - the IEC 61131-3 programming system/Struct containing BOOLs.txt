HiI'm quite new here so please excuse me if this sounds stupid or anything. I've just yesterday come across the Struct-Type for working with input-data sent from my hardware via profibus. The Struct-Type was once automatically added by some Script or something, not sure, it works really nice and generates me a struct with 6 bytes in it. So i thought, thats nice i'm gonna convert myself a WORD im beeing sent from an other device to 16 BOOL because each BOOL signals something different. so now i set this up like the working one but instead of the 6 byte-vars i put 16 bool vars there. But when i Compiled and uploaded to my CPU the Data was really weird. It looked like the CPU tried to write the whole WORD into the first BOOL (Signaled by 16#23 or something). My question now is: Is that some kind of Bug or did i just do something wrong?I don't have the exact qc here right now, its on the working-pc and i'm at home but i'll post it tomorrow. thanks in advanceSek

As far as I know a struct of 16 bools (or an array of 16 bools) does not get addresed as a word. Instead, each bool in the structure (or array) uses up a byte (if you have "Byte addressing". At least that's how it works on my target platform.

Sounds Logical but unfortunate Is there any reasonable way to map a Word to a Struct 16 individual Bool-Variables besides the long way?I'm not very familiar with the inner logic of Variable-space association. thanks in advanceSek

yes you can use pack and unpack this will make a word of a lot of bits.and a bool is 1 byte.

no you can not use functions inside structures however you can use unpack on part of a strucand no you can not change a bool in a byte however you can change a bit inside a byte and test on it.if bit5 of byte is true then bool5 is trueif bool5 then byte = byte or bit5 bit5 is a byte with bit5 set on so (0001 0000) =32(make bit0 to bit7)
