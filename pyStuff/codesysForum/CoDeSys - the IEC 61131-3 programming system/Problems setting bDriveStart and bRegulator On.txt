Hello guys!It's my first topic here and please excuse me if I have not chosen the right place to post.I am relatively new to CodeSys  I have a Schneider Electric LMC20 motion controller and two servo axes (Lexium32A).I have configured everything and it runs without major troubles. There is one, actually. Whatever I do, I am unable to set bDriveStart and bRegulatorOn to TRUE via code. I tried all possible ways, but they just don't get to TRUE. This way, I am forced to connect my computer every time, switch them ON manually via the build-in visualisations and then run the rest of the problem.I have tried the following:via ST --> bRegulatorOn := TRUE;It doesn't work that way, unfortunately.Do you have any ideas what could be causing this?

Hello,a code snippet would be great...Propose to do it like that:mcp: MC_Power;(*Set the inputs*)mcp.Enable:=TRUE;mcp.bDriveStart:=TRUE;mcp.bRegulatorOn:=TRUE;(*call the instance*)mcp( Axis:=Drive );or the same approach would be:mcp( Enable:=TRUE , bRegulatorOn:=TRUE , bDriveStart:= TRUE, Axis:=Drive);cuEdwin
