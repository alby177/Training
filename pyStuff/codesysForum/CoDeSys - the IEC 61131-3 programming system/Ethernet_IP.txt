Is it possible to make a PLC programmed with CoDeSys and having an ethernet port talk to AllenBradley on Ethernet/IP; ie is there any library that can handle Ethernet/IP? I found a library for ModbusTCP can anyone out there help me with EthernetIP?

I'd like to know the answer to this also.  

Anyone?

Hello,

to create own Ethernet-Communication there is a lib called syslibsockets.lib and depending of your target a lib called TcpUdpLib.lib

ask for examples a the 3S-support :=)
