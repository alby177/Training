Hello everybody,

I want to do that.

I have a program in CoDeSys and I want to save some variable in a database (access). 
It's possible to do that?
And how?

Thank you for your response.

If you are looking at getting process data (i.e. from the running system) I think the way to do this would be with some sort of OPC client that could get the information from the OPC Server

Something like this should work:

although I've never used it.

You could write your own Visual Basic program to do this which I know can be done because one of my engineers has done it.

Besides OPC, CoDeSys still has DDE. I had positive experience supplying MS Excel from the Gateway <- RS232 <- PLC. If yours data is changing not too fast it could approach yours requirement. 
Otherwise, use OPC and if you still need more fast and flexible solution then draw attention on PLC Handler from 3S.
