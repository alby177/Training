Hallo,

I need a simple Tool for simulation purposes. I want test a new material flow control (MFC) software. The idea is to realize the telegram communication between the MFC in use and the PLC with the new MFC.

Therefore I want to implement a simple PLC program, which can receive and send manually telegrams to the MFC prototype. There should not be any logic in the tool. It shall display the incoming telegrams. And should send manually telegrams.

(According to the functional specification the communication between MFC and PLC base on TIM, V1.03 05/1996)

Telegram example:
sender_receiver_someotherdata_anotherdata_xxx

I am a newbie in PLC programming. My task in the first place is creating a MFC prototype. But to develop that, I need a communication partner to have a test system.

My question:
Are there any detailed tutorial or sample project which could I use as a basis for my tool? To have a good starting point, would help me a lot.

Thanks in advance.

Regards!
Max
