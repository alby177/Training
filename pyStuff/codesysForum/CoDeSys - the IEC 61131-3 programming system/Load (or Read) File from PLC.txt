New to Wago and new to the board.  I have an existing (and functioning) PLC 750-841.  I need to upload the configuration from the PLC (I do not have an offline configuration file saved).  I've had some trouble connecting via Ethernet (another topic) so I connected via RS-232.  After logging in, I select "Read File from PLC" and get the following error:The last online service has not been executed correctly!Servive number: 49, Error number: 80File "<filename>" could not be read.I also tried to upload the file by choosing File->Open->Open file from PLC and get the same error.  What's going on?Thanks.

Dear sirMay be the source code was not downloaded.If this is not done, we cannot upload the program from PLC..!!

this is impossible as the program is compiled on a computer and only the machinecode is sended to the PLC.So without a file on computer not possible to retrieve the program.

Online -> Read file from PLC -> You have to specify exact file name (e.g. Project.pro) and you get it, but only if this file have been writen before (Online -> Write this file to PLC)
