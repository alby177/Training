Hello,

I am writing a program that will be reading data from a modem over the serial port.  I have the program up and mostly functional.  Currently I have a feeling that the data I am reading is not contiguous.  

dwSizeOfBuffer := SysComRead(iComPort, ADR(chInBuffer), SIZEOF(chInBuffer), 10);strInBuf := pInBuffer^;IF(dwSizeOfBuffer > 0) THEN          dwSizeHistory[j] := dwSizeOfBuffer;          strArrInBuffer[j] := pInBuffer^;	(* 512 strings *)          j := j + 1;          IF(j = 32) THEN                j:=0;          END_IFEND_IF


It seems that the strings will sometimes be located in two element of the strArrInBuffer[] and this causes a problem when trying to parse out the information.  If I have to I can add the strings together, but I would prefer to have a clean read into one variable.  Any ideas on what I am doing incorrectly?

Hello,

The problem or what I think it is problem is that I am receiving multiple sizes from the function SysComRead().  An example would be:


Expected:
$R$N+SBDIX: 18, 245, 2, 0, 0, 0$R$N$R$NOK$R$N 

Actual:
$R$N+SBDIX
: 18, 245, 2, 0,
 0, 0$R$N$R$NOK$R$N
