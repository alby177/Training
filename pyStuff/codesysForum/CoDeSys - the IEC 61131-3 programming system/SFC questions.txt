Iam trying to solve couple issues with SFC. Any help would be highly appreciated.1. en each step i have set time limit. How can i use this to a) exit sequence or b) to jump into stopping actions (for example stopping step and then go on from there)2. how exit conditions work? if i set one in step and then i open it. and i put there box of AND with both conditions TRUE how this will exit step? Or where does it exit? jus normally it goes on when next transition is met or how? 3. I could not find any good examples about codesys SF. DOes anybody know where to find one?Thanks

1 Make the transition just TRUE.then if you use a MIN time like t#10s the step will be running for 10 seconds and then next step will startif use MAX and same then the step 1 will only run one time and the go to step2if transition is false the step1 will run for 10 seconds and then wait until the transition is true.2 If the step1 is enterd the actions in the enter will be executed once and the every thing inside the step for as long as the step is running.the exit will be done when the step is left, or by timer, or by transition.example step1active:=true in enterand step1active:=false in exit.3 just send what you are making preferably in a flowsheet (visio or smartdraw) and i will give you a headstart.

How do you exit a SFC program? I mean, how do you make a secondary SFC program break (quit), after a transition and return to the execution of the main one?I have tried typing "EXIT" at the Jump action (seemed logical   ), but that didn't work.

there is no exit or return in an SFC (i do agree with you it should be possible)however you can make it with jumps.

Thank you Paul. But what should I type in the Jump action? "PLC_PRG" doesn't work. It gives the classical error "Jump to undefined step PLC_PRG".

If you jump back to init, it will return to master program.
