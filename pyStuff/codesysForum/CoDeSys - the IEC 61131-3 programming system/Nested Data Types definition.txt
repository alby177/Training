I was looking at the possibility of creating nested data types in CoDeSys 2.3 (as in Simatic). Is this possible? Something like the below:
TYPE Test :
STRUCT
	Real1: REAL;
	Real2: REAL;
	RealSet: STRUCT
		Real3; REAL;
		Real4: REAL;
	END_STRUCT;
END_STRUCT
END_TYPE

Hi,
you can do this, but first you have to declare the "inner" type separately. 
Code:TYPE TRealSet: STRUCTReal3; REAL;Real4: REAL;END_STRUCTEND_TYPEThis you can use now as follows:Code:TYPE Test :STRUCTReal1: REAL;Real2: REAL;RealSet: TRealSet;END_STRUCTEND_TYPE
