Hi,      Can any give me an example of how %M is used in the program,means where I have to declare this ?Thanks

same place as you would do with the in and outputsI tend to put them all global so i can see and change them anywhere.

They can declared anywhere in declaration.  Below are examples myBool  AT %MX0.0 : BOOL; //Boolean TypemyInput AT %IX0.0 : BOOL;myOut   AT %QX0.0 : BOOL;myByte  AT %MB0   : BYTE; //Byte TypemySINT  AT %MB0   : SINT;myUSINT AT %MB0   : USINT;myByteArary AT %MB0 : ARRAY[0..10] OF BYTE; myWORD  AT %MW0   : WORD; //16 bit typesmyINT   AT %MW0   : INT;myUINT  AT %MW0   : UINT;myWordArary AT %MW0 : ARRAY[0..10] OF WORD; myDWORD AT %MD0   : DWORD; //32bit TypesmyDINT  AT %MD0   : DINT;myUDINT AT %MD0   : UDINT;myReal  AT %MD0   : REAL;myDwordArray AT %MD0 : ARRAY[0..10] OF DWORD;mySTRING AT %MB0 : STRING;  //STRING

Hi,     Thanks for the reply.What is the difference betweensarath:array [1..10] of DWORD; and  myDwordArray AT %MD0 : ARRAY[0..10] OF DWORD; Is it just that %MD0 is known location?Thanks 

yes it is a known location , and you when having several PLC in a communication like the old MODBUS you can ask any plc for a memory location and get its results.Many HMI displays work with these MARKERS.

Maybe this will help.  This is an excel sheet with how the memory is aligned.  Like Shooter said not all PLC/HMI align the memory the same.  This sheet is based off SoMachine/Vijeo hardware built by SE.
