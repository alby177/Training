HelloI am using a Wago controller 750881 with library NetVarUdp_LIB_V23.libI have big difficulties with network variables function:Having 1 controller as producer and 20 controllers as consumer, I see that only part of the consumers are refreshed with the correct values. :First of all I would like to know if I am using the correct library. On previous projects I was using the same features and library with controller 750841 and did not encounter such problems.Is it possible that AM library is not compatible with 750881?

it is depending on the software version you are using.check with wago if compatible.or give me the version you are running and the serial on you 881 and i will ask office.
