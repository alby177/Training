Hi,

I like to run a non-CoDeSys real time task together with the CoDeSys runtime. AFAIK, the priorities that can be set in the CoDeSys environment are RTAI priorities. Correct?

Next, I like to use the non-CoDeSys task to get input from my CoDeSys task, and be able to give output back.
Meaning is to be able to fetch information from a remote database, and feed it into the PLC task.

Thanks for any anwsers.

Communicating between the CoDeSys program and Linux should be possible through /dev/plcvar, according to Kontron.

But that's empty  

Any other idea's? Shared memory is an option, but I cannot figure out how to write to it from my PLC program.

What about communication using FIFO or socket?
