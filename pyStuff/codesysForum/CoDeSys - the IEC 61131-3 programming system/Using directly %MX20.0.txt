Hello
Is it possible to use directly %MX20.0 for example as an entry of a box, as an Action in SFC, or is it necessary to declare a variable with a name and so on ? I would like to use it (or a byte, a word...) like a memento with Step7.
Thanks
G. Thomas

Yes, of course, it is possible.
Just try it, there is no risk.
