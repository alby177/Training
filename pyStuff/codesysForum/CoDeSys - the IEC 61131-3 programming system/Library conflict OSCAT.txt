Please, I need help!! I tried to install the OSCAT library, I got so many errors so I decided to delete it, since then I can't get back into my PLC. I get the ERROR Unresolved external POU's. Even if I go back to a previously saved project, I get the same error. I can't access my plc, and it isn't in RUN. My whole house is paralyzed.please see attachment.Hope you can help me out here.

go to setup and change the number of POU, oscat is very big, so needs a lot of space.If keeping problems, try to minimize the functions, check the TXT version.
