I have a strange problem, I have a variable, declared as a REAL.A line in my code goes like this:MyVarA:=MyVarA + 0.1;That should, in my world, gives:0.00.10.20.30.40.50.60.7Aso.But for some reason it goes like:0.040.140.250.350.450.550.650.750.86What is going on?

A real is not exact, so it is close but can have a difference in result.As the printing is not nicely rounded but just cut off, you can have strange results, i do expect more problems like is it a global var or do you do anything starnge with it, the only answer is when you send the complete program.counting is best done as an Unsigned Integer and the transfered to real.so your formula is better when adding oneand then the result Int_to_real and div by 10

First I was afraid that the switch in the water counter was bouncing due to the fact that I was counting more that the mechanically meter showed on the water counter, but when I looked into the var during execution, and I see this strange counting rhythm/gait and was thinking WTF is this?Quote:counting is best done as an Unsigned Integer and the transfered to real.so your formula is better when adding oneand then the result Int_to_real and div by 10This was my next approach, I will try that out.
