Dear Sir/Madam:
  I am an assistant programmer from China, I have some questions about 
the new software CoDeSys V3.0.
1.I have downloaded the new version of the CoDeSys PLC software development kit(Demo), I was surprised with the new object-oriented 
method, and this makes the programming procedure like the JAVA or the 
C++. But is this method indeed compatible with the IEC61131-3 or is this method indeed necessary to the automatic engineering?Because I found it difficult to associate with the OO method with the functionblock method while I am programming.

Hi
the next article explain some ideas:
Object-oriented extensions of the IEC 61131-3

__________________IP_

Hello, this article explain well the concept.
But I would like to know if COdesys V3 converts SFC or other IEC61131 language into JAVA language.
I mean, I would like to write my program in IEC61131 and have it converted to a java program.
Is that possible?
I would appreciate your help.

Nicolas

It is not possible.
CoDeSys generates executable machine code. Additionly it is necessary to have CoDeSys SP runtime inside a hardware (PLC). It is special software (like an operation system) for encapsulation all hardware dependent parts, I/O configurations and drives, fieldbus support,   debugger, libraries etc. If you even convert IEC in Java by some miracle, then you get a trouble how to connect your variables with I/O. So, you will need to write a lot addition functions and finally you will write complete runtime system â€“ identical to CoDeSys SP. 
Summary: 1) it is impossible 2) there are no reason for it.
