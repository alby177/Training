I am new to SFC and I think I am having a problem.  At any point in the SFC flow I would like to give a command to move to a certain step (a re-home step).  As you can see in the attached picture I am setting an IEC action to look for this command.  When the command is given it does jump to the step I intend.  The only problem is it appears I have 2 steps active.  (1.) the step that I wanted to jump to from the action, and (2) the step I was on before the command was given.  Is this a problem?  If so, are there any suggestions to fix this problem?Also, I have a couple of actions that are set in the beginning of the program (with IEC step) and never reset.  The reason I am doing this is because I need to monitor I/O and variables?  Is this a correct way of doing this?  Is appears to be working just fine but wanted to know if these is bad programming practice.Thanks.

it is not wise to jump to an action. you need a state machine for this, you can use some extra transitions, when a homing is needed.
