Hi,

( Is High DWORD and Low DWORD) 

I need save actual time and compare. But for better operate I wanted to convert into second.  I need doword. 

My first idea :

  i :=  (PlcTick.ulLow / 1000000) + (PlcTick.ulHigh * 10000);

!! Wrong !!

If ulLow have 16#FFFFFFFF and add ulHigh. Is bad result, surely. 

I try 

 i := 	pom := SHR(PlcTick.ulLow, 20) + SHL(PlcTick.ulLow, remainder); 

Not exactly 1 second. At 5 minute, longer about 15sec! WHY ??? 
Where is the problem?
