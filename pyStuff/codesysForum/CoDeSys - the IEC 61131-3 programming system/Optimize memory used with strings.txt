Hi,
I work on a project with a lot of display text and I search to optimize the memory used for that. 
Yet, strings are write in a array of string as that:
  In Global_Variable : 
   My_Display: ARRAY[1..18,1..17] OF STRING(13); 
  In an POU: 
    My_Display[5,10]:='Something' ;


Have we some some craftiness for that?

Thanks.
