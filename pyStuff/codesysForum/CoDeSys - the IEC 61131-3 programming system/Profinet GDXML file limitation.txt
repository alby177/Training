Hi everrybody I'm using a Parker PLC which is called PAC.Inside this PLC, I insert a Profinet Slave which driver is done by Codesys 3S (as shown here)Name: NetX PN DeviceVendor : 3S-Smart Software Solutions GmbhCategories: Profinet IO DeviceType:83ID: 0000 0085Version : 3.5.5.0I put the Xml description file in this post.Inside the file, I have a max of 23 'devices' of 8 words limitation for the Input and Ouptut communication.It seems that the Siemens PLC (master) has a limitation of 53 devices of 8 words each in Input / Output.I've tried to change by hand this limitation of 23.Communication works until 30 devices (of 8 words each).as soon as I set 31, it is not working anymore.Does someone knows why I have this limitation?It seems to be a cyclic communication, do I have an acyclic channel as well?If so how can I use it?As it is a 3S device, I hope someone will be able to help me on this topic!Thanks by advance!
