HiI try and save real assets from an energy meter.But I'm not sure how I can do it.I've used oscat_basic.lib and METER, METER_STAT to see my meter values. But how can I save real values every hour.I want to log kW top average value for every houre.Duration in minutes: M1, M2, M3, M4 ... M60kW value: kW1, kW2, KW3, kW4 ... kW60Average hourly kW value: H1, H2, H3, H4 ... H24Then I want to save the 3 highest values for the months.3 highest values in months: Mont_1_1, Mont_1_2, Mont_1_3, Mont_2_1, Mont_2_2, Mont_3_3 ... Mont_12_1, Mont_12_2, Mont_12_3When a new year starts the values for the months will be overwrithen.I need some help to start on how to do this. An example on how to store a value in specified intervals would be grate, what function blocks should I use? Please try to explain inn FBD or CFC.Thanks for all the helpEspen (newbie)

Since you are already using Oscat basic, I suggest you look into the Oscat Network lib for this. It has the DATA_LOGGER component to store data. You can store in a CSV file on the PLC itself with the DLOG_STORE_FILE_CSV component. Or HTML, XML. Store on an SD card if your PLC has this. Use DLOG_FILE_TO_SMTP or DLOG_FILE_TO_FTP to have your PLC send the file to an email address or upload to an FTP server.

what PLC are you using, and where do you like to save the data.and indeed have a look in oscat network.

HiThanks for your replay.I now have a WAGO 750-849. Otherwise, I tend to use WAGO 750-831.So it should work on both PLCs.I read the documentation codesys_network_121_hf1and thought DLOG_REAL can be used.But when I enter lib file and compiles then I get an error message.<Maximum number of POUs (1023) exceeded compile is aborted>I changed the settings in <of target> maximum number of Pous 2023>When I get errorsBASE64_DECODE_STRBASE64_DECODE_STREAMDLOG_DTDLOG_FILE_TO_SMTP...XML_READERI tried and create a new small program. With only a few blocks.I increased max POUs and it gets compiled but with error on memory.When I chose 'exclude unused' and got compiled and downloaded.But how do I get used values from DLOG on.Is there a better approach?Espen (Newbie)(Does this also as sign so I know what I've done and how I got it fixed.)

Hello.I think I found an easier way and bring out the effects of each hour. And take care of the highest impact measured.But I have not found any good solution and take care of the daily value so I can find the 3 highest values ​​in months. Or how to save the months view.I thought ARRAY can be used. Also had been fine and could list the date, time measurements were from.Do you have any good ideas? I have tested some, and tryied to find som more information. Here is a link to the program. https://www.dropbox.com/.../8cdsdg07... ... ter3.pro...Espen
