As far as I know, theres no standard algorithm for this included in CoDeSys.

You'll have make your own, unless your vendor supplies one.
For theory take a engineeringcourse in adaptive conctrol

ther is no such ting like a general autotune algorithm for everything.
there are many autotuning algorithms but all for a niche aplication and only a limited range of use.

general autotune for pid does not exist.

good books are
digital self tuning controllers, springer
advanced pid control, ISA
