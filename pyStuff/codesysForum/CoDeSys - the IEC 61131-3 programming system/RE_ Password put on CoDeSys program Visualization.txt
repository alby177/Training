Dear Holz,This is Abu Sayem from Favelle Favco Australia. I need to know about the password protection of the any CoDeSys file.Currently I am using one project which includes visualization page. What I want is, don't allow to edit customer inside the program but they will be able to see the visualization page.Could you please help me?On the project, I have found Option for password and user group password but there is no information about putting password on the coding. So if we deliver the project Customer can see the coding also visulization page and there will be a risk of changing some values by thirdparty.It could be dangerous for crane safety matter. Please assist.RegardsAbu Sahahdat Sayem28Yarrunga Street, PrestonsNSW 2170, Australia
