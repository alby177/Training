Hello,we have acquired set of Festo CPX-CEC-C1 PLCs for student lab. The problem is when one PC access the PLC, that PLC becomes invisible for all other PCs in the lab. After PLC Configuration -> Network Configuration -> Search network is performed we get "Could not find any device." message. Even after first PC logs out, PLC is invisible on all other PCs.The idea is that we have various systems controlled by specific PLCs and every student has to try to download his own program to PLC in order to test it.

I would use one PC connected to all PLC.if a student wants his program, put it on a stick, walk to the floor, and download it, it is more done in factories, and the network stays always up.or give every PLC its own PC.so the student makes the software offline (normal) uses the simulator and after test then walks to the production line.(compiling etc can better be done on main PC, so all settings are correct)this way everyone can have its own codesys and no worries about comms.this has to do with IP addresses, they should be all the same only last one is different.

Thank you for fast reply. Suggested solution is an option, but I prefer that every PC has access to every PLC. IP addresses of PLCs and PCs  differ only in last number (have first three numbers same).Is it possible to have access every PLC from all PCs? Does not have to be at the same time, but after someone logs out, someone else can log in.

This search for PLC is a Festo extension, did you ever try just to set the communinication parameters manualy? As far as I know this is possible also with Festo. On the other hand I suggest to contact the Festo support. Your drawn scenario is not untypical and should work.Best RegardsRalph

Hi             If all the PLC are in the same network then using IP address you can access but need to have a network hub and each PLC shud have different IP address and you can use UDP network selection to have inter network operability between PLC.
