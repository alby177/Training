Dear Colleagues,

For several months now I am trying to figure out how a particular state transaction of the CANopen Slaves in the 3S_CANopenMaster.lib works.  If the heartbeat producer function is activated for the slaves, then sometimes the state change from 3 to 99 without any obvious reason.  If it is appropriate I would like to understand the logic underneath. Can you please clarify to me all the possible check condition the library makes before it decides if the node should go either to 4 or to 99? Does the number of slave nodes on the bus somehow affect that decision? Why the heartbeat timer is activated in latter situation? I am an OEM in testing face and your knowledge is priceless.

Kind Regards,
Dimitris Armenis, PhD, MIET

If you look at my other posts I had trouble with the node state changing unpredictably. Do you have the CANopen for 3s runtime documentation? If you don't let me know and I believe it is ok to post here? It explains the node status changes and state machine. I am assuming you are refering to nStaus of the CANopen nodes structure.

Hi spfeif,

Can you provide me the 3s runtime documentation.

rgds,
rahul.

it will not let me upload the file. States the file size is too large although it's 380kb and the web site states 1MB limit?
