Hello,i got following problem:I reset my plc's using command SysResetPlcProgram(x); (x = 0,1). After reset my program, which is running on the plc, the program stops. Is there anyway to run the program again, without doing this manually by starting the application by hand (F5) ?

why do you reset, is the plc autostart (on wago it is a switch)

I want to test some functions with persistent and retain variables, after cold reset and warm reset. If i add an boot application the plc prog autostarts (there is no switch or something at my plc / autostart is enabled) until the first reset in the code. From there i have to log in the debugger and continue the program manually.

After SysResetPlcProgram(RESET_COLD); the boot project is not automatically loaded.

you have to make the project bootable.
