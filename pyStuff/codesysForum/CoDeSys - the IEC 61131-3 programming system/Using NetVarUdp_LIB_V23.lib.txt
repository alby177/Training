Hello. Do you have some information how are use functions and functional blocks at library NetVarUdp_LIB_V23.lib? My targethaven't got 'Parameter Manager' for configure of the variables and process-independent parameters in parameter lists. In this case I no have any information for the index and subindex of the used variables, which will be transfered. These index and subindex are inputs for the functional block NetVarSDO_Udp. How to get this information for variables with other functional block? Thank you in advance.
