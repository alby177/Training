Hello,

I've got a question about how to use the "pragma" instruction to create an object dictionary for a CANopen slave/device.

I 've used the pragma (parameter list) to create an object dictionary for variables (BYTE, UINT etc). that works perfect

Height:UINT{parameter list=ObjectDictionary [name="Height" index=16#6022 subindex=16#0 Accesslevel=Low Accessright="read only" Value=65535 Min=0 Max=65535 ] };

The problem is that some of the parameters/variables are of ARRAY type.
I've read in the manual that i can use the pragma (instance list) to accomplish this. 

Control: ARRAY [0..5] OF BYTE{instance list=Controlbytes template=ARRAY baseindex=16#6000 basesubindex=16#1 [name=Controlbyte_1 Accesslevel=Low Accessright="write only"] };

The problem is that these indexes are not visible/selectable in the Default PDO mapping tab of the slave!

I've tried to set the Mapping indexes in "Target settings" but it does not work...

Does anyone know if it's possible to use the instance list for this?

HiHave you found a solution to this issue? I am having the same problem. The CoDeSys Manual states, "If supported by the target system, parameter lists of type 'Mapping' can be created in the Parameter Manager, which contain process variables especially intended for the PDO mapping of a CANDevice. In this case only these parameter lists will be offered here in the mapping dialog. Otherwise all available parameter lists of type 'Variables' and 'Instance' will be offered." (PLC Configuration 6-44 CoDeSys V2.3(version E)). I have not specified an index range for mappings, only for parameters and variables.When I try configure a CANOpen slave device, the "List of mappable objects" under the "Defaults PDO mapping" tab only the "Variable" parameter lists are visible, the "Instance" parameter list never show up. In defining the Instance parameter list I have used the ARRAY template and started the subindex at 16#1. The list has 8 subindexes. Creating the parameter list works fine, how do we make it visible to the Default PDO Mapping?
