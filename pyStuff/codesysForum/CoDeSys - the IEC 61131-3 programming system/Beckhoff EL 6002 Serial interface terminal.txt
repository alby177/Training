Hi there. I have a Beckhoff CX8090 coupled to a EL 6002. I am trying to read in the string from a barcode scanner but I cannot read in any values. I have attched the program. I have tried various ways to create links within the Systems manager but no matter what I do, it does not appear to help. I have a feeling that the problem lies within the system manager configuration of the serial communication. I am not able to load the Systems manager file as the forum sends a reply to state that tsm extensions are not allowed. I have however attached the program.Your assistance will be greatly appreciated. Kind regards, Russell
