Hi,I wrote a program about heating-cooling system and want it to start every morning at 6:00 am and stop every evening at 19:00 pm.And I need hour and minute knowledge.I used the block SysRTCGetTime but it only shows system time.How can I get the hours and minutes from this block or is there any other way to get hour nad minute ?Thank you,in advanceMurat

I think you can be helped by one of the Oscat (http://www.oscat.de/) libraries. More specifically the functions Minute and Hour.

kberlin,Thank you very much,I found the blocks which I need at this site..

Happy to help. Did you also take a look in the Oscat Building Automation library? I think the TIMER_2 function block might be useful for you.Best regards,Kristian Berlin

I've just looked.It's also so usefull.I can use this block,as well.My project has just finished,after I start up the system,I'll check all the library,there are lots of usefull blocks at there.Thank you Murat
