How can I make symbols in Global Variable?I am able to create "SYM_XML" file with the main project file (CoDeSys V2.3.9.13 and select PLC model Wago 750-841(FW12...))I just need to create some symbols in "SYM_XML" file. But I am a beginner of using CoDeSys and struggling to understand the software.If you someone have a sample program or sample "SYM_XML" with BOOL, INT, DINT or something,would you mind to share?

export the global var.

I'm not sure what you mean by symbols. If by symbols you mean variables to use in your program, the syntaxes are as follows:VAR_GLOBAL	MyVar_Bool :BOOL;	MyVar_Byte:BYTE;	MyVar_Word:WORD;	MyVar_DWord:DWORD;	MyVar_DInt:DINT;	MyMem_Bool 	   AT %MX0.0 : BOOL;	MyMem_Byte 	   AT %MB0    : BYTE;	MyMem_Word        AT %MW0   : WORD;	MyMem_DWord      AT %MD0    : DWORD;	MyMem_DInt	   AT %MD1    : DINT; END_VAR
