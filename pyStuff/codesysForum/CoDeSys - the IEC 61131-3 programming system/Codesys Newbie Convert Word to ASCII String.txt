Hello AllI am a newbie to Codesys...about 3 weeks. I have an HMI where an operator can choose a filename to execute.The filename is 10 words long, 2 characters per word.The filename e.g. "PROG1" is selected from the HMI and sent over Modbus to the Festo PLC.On the Modbus, the filename text "PROG1" seen as 3 wordsWord1: Decimal Value  = 21072Word2: Decimal Value  = 18255Word3: Decimal Value  = 49The question is how can I convert a value of any length word(s) from their Decimal Value to the ASCII equivalent string and read it back into a variable ? From this ...Word1+Word2+Word3 .....How do I get this ----> "PROG1" Can someone help the newbie ?? Please let me know if more clarification is needed..thanksJL

SOLVED : Take 3 WORDS and convert back to the ASCII String that the Words representThe Words : Word1-  Decimal Value : 21072Word2-  Decimal Value : 18255Word3-  Decimal Value : 49The 3 Words Converted back to a String = "PROG1".....as seen in the attached picture, (the value for the result variable "sProgramName")
