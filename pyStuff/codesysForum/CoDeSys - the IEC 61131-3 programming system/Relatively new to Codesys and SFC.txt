I'm using Codesys to learn PLC programming and now I have to make an assigment in SFC.First, I can't find an explanation about the different variable types. I see just VAR or VAR_INPUT etc.What are the differences?Second, can I use logic in transitions like "bStart AND (seDockingUp AND seLidlifterOutwards)"?bStart is declared as VAR and seDockingUp and seLidlifterOutwards are declared as VAR_INPUTif I run a program with this transition in simulation mode, the program does not continue when I make them all TRUE. I don't see why.  My idea is to reset the bStart in the next step. Where and how do I declare initial start values for specific booleans?Thanks for you help
