Some one could tell me how can I put recipes om CPX plc and access then from IHM Fed-50!? i think that is by Parameter Manager, but what index I should use?! that who are on example of target settings?!Thank You

just give a number in a variable and let the plc sort it out what it must do.like use SELECT
