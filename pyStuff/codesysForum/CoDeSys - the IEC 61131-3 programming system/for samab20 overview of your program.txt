did have a look at the program:what is target? as this is lost when loading in my software (normal as i can not have all models software. or include target pleasesame for several libraries as these are also not included, see window library managerso i can not simulate the program due to missing libs.PLC_PRG0001 always_on define it in global var by Always_on :BOOL:=TRUE;0002 i can not find declaration but probably it is in configuration.scaling is not correct as the module has the lowest bits as alarm, see oscat or first convert the word to correct dependent of the inputmodule some are only 10 bits most are 12 bits but bit0,1,2 are used for alarm and overflow. this is done with shifting the word right 3 places and your inmax will be 2^10. look for AIN in oscatmake all these numbers variable like -50 32765 0 50 etc. now you can make a visualisation to change it, helping in calibration and simulation.0003 same as above0004 toggle_FB is simple done with SR look on iconbar rightside. watch the sequence as now the highest number is highest priority.0005 where is switch off?0006 this means the time is always resetted make this a variable, no outputs are used so block is not needed. It does work i think.0007 first why not going up it was disorienting for me, but seems to workwhy first calculating the a and byou can also use y=(x-x1)/(x1-x2)*(y1-y2)+y1 as it is a straight linein oscat it is called LINEAR_INThugo uses a arrayhave also a look at POLYNOM_INT it works with a 5 point polynomcheck his comment on the polynom.my comment is that this needs to be set by an expert and should be changeable on a separate screen.0008 this is done with SEL from standard libwhy asking for if it is different just do it0009 also SEL0010 see LIMITALARM in util.lib high is setpoint+tolerance etc.0011 do not have this block so no comment on it.here same make all numbers like 0.1 etc VARiables so they are changeable without changing program.0012 do this with same scale as used above0013 you can do this in one go with toggle on the visualisation0014 0015 see comment 00020016 see 00100017 what is this?0018 see 00110019 see 0012rest looks okeI see you have done all in one programuse an init program to set everything. see in resources tasksyou can also call programs from within PLC_PRGthis makes maintenance easier as the main is not to big.i tend to keep this very small and let it call all others.visualisationscan not read aika have a look at languages or put a english below it so anybody can have a look, is good when international is oimportant.lampokuva looks nice, i do not know what all the KL LV means but diagram is good.both valves could be put in a visualisation with placeholdersIf it is this small make yourself a rectangle and have the scale with a move of the upper right corner. (just try it)color the lines with red and blueis this all tempsensors available?Main why not put the actual temps and their conversion on this screen.have the lampokuva also as a visu on this screen, and when tapped jump _ to visu . no need to do in programPID_Tv1 put it in top left easier to input in another screen.also possible to do this with placeholders (forst insert two same visualisations in one screen and then you can set the placeholders.for two vis not important but when using more it is faster.GeneralNo arrays are used nor data types.good enough for today
