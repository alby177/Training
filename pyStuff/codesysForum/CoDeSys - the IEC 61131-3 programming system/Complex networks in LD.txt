Hi,

I am usign Wago CoDeSys and need to be able to draw a network of contacts. It is basically two legs, each with two contacts in series but I want these two legs to be in parallel.

I can only seem to put single contacts in parallel.

Can anyone tell me how to do this (sorry for the bad drawing)?

So if I understand you correct, you want two serial contact's parallell to teo more contact's.

Use 'shift-key' to mark the to serial contact's and use tool for parallell to make the parallell branch, 
mark up the single contact in parallell branch and use tool for single contact.
