Hi....

IÂ´'m working in one project, so i need to put one force like sine wave in linear motor. Please help me to do it in FBD. I already tried to use GEN fuction but  the library of c3 dont let me use the library util.lib. i dint know why. 

I'm working with compacx3 and one linear motor of parker...


Thanks.

is your compacx able to run this version 3?
probably you will need version 2.3 and that should be no problem as you can use gen from the util.lib.
however you could have a look at the oscat.lib
they have al sorts of generators and are all is written in ST so you do not need to load a full library.
download both the lib version and the TXT version
if you use one function on compiling it will miss several functions, you will have to copy and paste them from the txt version .
this way you can keep the program very small.

btw better to use a special hardware as maxspeed in software will be 50 Hz. (cycle time of 10 ms.)
there are special blocks like beckhoff and wago and lenze and siemens etc.

you will need 3 pwm outputs and a table with positions.

if hardware used you only give a speed and hardware does rest.

Hi,
C3 has defined libraries and you can't do all with it.
In order to perform a Sinus movement, you need to create a task_500 POU which will create a task that turn at 500us.
Then in the C3manager create a source signal for a gearing movement.
This movement should be started in the normal codesys function.
In the 500us task you need to calculate your Sin movement and send it in the C3Plus.HEDA_SignalProcessing_Input.
Be carefull, precision of real in the c3 are in ^2 decimal factor.
AND codesys 3 is not possible, only 2.3.9.9
That's it

good luck
