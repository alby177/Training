Good Day,I have a Dynamometer that is controlled with a Turck BL20 PG-EN that was programed by a previous employee and we have no backup of the PLC program.   I have loaded CoDeSys 2.3  and can not find any function for uploading the PLC program to PC.    I used Twido Suite to upload the programs(Twido PLC's) from our other two dynamometers and it was quite simple and straight forward.   So the question is can someone point me in the right direction as to how to upload a program from the Turck to my PC without jeopardizing the operation of the Dyno?   I am not a programmer so if possible dumb down any response.   Thanks

there is no way to upload a compiled program.

WOW!  That _,  not user friendly for sure.

Actually after speaking to Turck it is possible to upload a program from PLC to PC,  if the source code was initially loaded onto the PLC.
