Hi, Where can I find codesys projects examples?

a lot of programming examples in st are in the open source library OSCAT
you can download the library from www.oscat.de
open the lib as a project and you can see all the source code

If you have used any Programming languages before like C/C++ then ST is very simlar. I found when I was starting off, opening up the library was useful to see what tools I had at my fingertips.

I realise I haven't directly answered your question but I hope the advice helps

yes anyone who has used a high level language before should be fine
ST is pretty much pascal
