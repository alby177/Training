Correct me if I made mistakes in terms or in substance.How to declare variables that I want to receive and transmit to the network (for example LON)? Throw a code example please. As far as I understand from the manual storage area that is preserved under the required network begins with a 256 word (type word) and ends 511 words. Therefore, if I want to declare a variable that will be transmitted to the network, the code is as follows:for entering variables:bI AT% IX256.0: BOOL; (* for the logical type *)dI AT% ID129: DWORD; (* for double-word type *)outgoing variables: bI1 AT% IX256.0: BOOL;bQ AT% QX256.0: BOOL; (* for the logical type *)dQ AT% QD129: DWORD; (* for double-word type *)Right? Controller: wago 750-819ctnm: Network LON. The controller has a slot that is in the description called FieldBus conection, it is through this connector and connect the network.
