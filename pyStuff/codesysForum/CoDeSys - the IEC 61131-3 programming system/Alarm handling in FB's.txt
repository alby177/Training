I am new to CoDeSys, mainly I am quite impressed with what I have seen this far, however I wonder if alarm configuration may only be done in the application by using Alarm Configuration/Class/group and storage objects.I find it much more "natural" to define alarms as parts of the function blocks (e.g. a function block for a valve should issue/manage tha alarms related to the actual instance of this valve FB).This way it would automatically be added if you add the FB.Is this really not possible ?

you can do it anywhere you like.im do not use the alarmhandler (only to test if plc is running)the rest is in function blockslook for a better software at www.oscat.dedownload the version for your codesys and the txt version you can read it, the docs are in english too.

Thanks for info and link.Unfortunately my Deutsch is weak, do you know english language url ?Any hint of how to define alarm handling ?I want to define e.g. a FB called from within an outer FB, the inner one must be a kind of finite state machine which serves opc server acc0ording to opcfoundation AE 1.10 spec.
