Hi,

I tray next me exam:

In buffer is saved structure. In first byte 
buffer[1] is byte item
buffer[2 - 5] is DWORD item (status bits) 

Code:buffer: ARRAY [1..1024] OF BYTE;tmp: POINTER TO DWORD;tmp := adr(buffer)+1;numdw := tmp^;

If I offset 1-3 is problem with byte older. Is not same as source array? If I offset about full DWORD is true. Way?
