I need to update a remote PLC (operation made by customer). How can I do it? (It's possible to share some "compiled" with the customer and then he'll download to the PLC without the chance to see my source code?wish I made clear what is my need..

depending on type of PLC you can send the compiled code and use a download program from factory.
