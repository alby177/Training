What does port programming mean? Please be more specific. Do you mean communicating through a serial,Ethernet,Profi,CAN bus running a soft version of CoDeSys? Or communication between your custom PC application and CoDeSys running on an embedded platform( Like the Gateway Server)? Or communication from an embedded platform through a specific port?
