Hi, there's my problem.I need to dinamically modify the inputs of a FB by using values which are given as input in a visualization window.Then I need to assing those values to another variables that are the outputs of the same FB.There's a way to do that?

make a project with a variable ie visinputspeed.on the visualisation make a square and as display make it visinputspeed.make it a input and choose the numeric keyboard.now you can change the value on the visualisation.is that what you mean?you can also use a slider etc.
