I have simple question. Does any libraries (inc oscat) have same type of functions as siemens step 7 have for codesys?The one functionality iam missing most is that when using fbd and i have simple ADD function in use. In Codesys i have to program several jumps and skips so that function is done only when i wanted it to be calculated. But in codesys (so far ) i have only ADD function what is missing that "Enable" input.With that i can easily add conditions when something gets calculated and when not. Now does anybody know if codesys have these ready or not? Now it would be ok to make one, but so far i noticed that codesys is handling functions differently. So that i have to use global var. and after that i need to use different function each time (no multiple instances possible when i have f-trig global). Can anybody understand what iam after here?

I only have access to V3 now but in that you have Box with Enable as an option when putting things like this into FB or LD.Perhaps that is what you are looking for.

you can use SELect function with on one side 0 and on the other a 1 for example.and you can use events so it will start a POU, when something happens.
