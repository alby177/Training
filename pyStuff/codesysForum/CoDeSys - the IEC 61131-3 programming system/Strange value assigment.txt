Hi,
I have fund something very strange. The value in a variable follow the value in an other variable without assigment bettween there.

Focus on code:
In global variable:
VAR_GLOBAL
	StateLanguage: INT:=0;
END_VAR
In a POU:
VAR
	LastLanguageTime: INT;
	change_Language: BOOL;
END_VAR

IF StateLanguage<>LastLanguageTime THEN
	LastLanguageTime:=StateLanguage;
	change_Language:=TRUE;
END_IF

IF change_Language=TRUE THEN
	(*lot of things*)
	change_Language:=FALSE;
END_IF

Describe of the problem:
The 2 local variable are not used in other part of the project (not 2 times the same name).
I download the program in the board and go in debug mode.
When StateLanguage is 1, LastLanguageTime become 1 and change_Language is lock at TRUE.
When StateLanguage is 2, LastLanguageTime become 2 and change_Language become "*** INVALID: 16#02 ***".
If I forced change_Language to FALSE, LastLanguageTime was locked to 0 and StateLanguage continu to evoluate in function of other part of the program.

Tried things:
Change names of variables.
Change position of declaration of these variables.

Precision:
My code use almost all the memory. What append with CoDeSys if we need more variables than possible in memory?
CoDeSys 2.3.4.1 and Target Controler Inside

Thanks,
