I'm trying to turn on any combination of 128 PLC outputs using 1 variable. I've never done this before so I wanted to see if any one has any suggestions. I would appreciate your input.  

One possibility (assuming your IO hardware is based on BOOL assignments) using ST language:Create a global array[0..127] of BOOLIf you are lucky and your hardware IO mapping supports it: assign the array to the outputs.  If you are not so lucky, you have to assign each variable individually (this is my case and I learned keyboard shortcuts very quickly...)Create a program called 'Outputs'Create an action called 'AllOn'In the action use a FOR/NEXT loop to set each element of the array to TRUECreate other actions for different situations (AllOff, Toggle, etc)From your main code, call Outputs.AllOn() to turn on all of your outputsYou may want to create a FB and use methods instead of a program with actions.This is just one example.  Check your hardware mapping - I have one hardware I work with (4 in / 4 out) that uses one BYTE to control the INs and one BTYE to control the OUTs - which would be super easy to turn all on at once (BYTE = 255).  But that is not the norm.I think trying to do this with LD would be a bit tedious.

way #1 hardware.put the ouputs behind a power supply module, so if you activate 1 output it will put power to the power module.this is done a lot for emergency buttons, as it shuts down the power to a lot of outputs.way #2softwarein SToutput1:= (output[1] AND centraloutput )in ladder obvious same type.
