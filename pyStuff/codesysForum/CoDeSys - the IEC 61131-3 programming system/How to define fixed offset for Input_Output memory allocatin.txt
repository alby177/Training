Hello,

Preamble:
I have a device with a bit complex configuration -
The device itself has some fixed Input/Output memory (1 WORD each). Then there are some user configurable functions by which it's In/Out image is extended. I have defined these user configurable functions as Plug-Ins. Then there are 3 fixed I/O slots on the Device, which can be configured with variety of modules.

Requirement:
Since Base device has variable Plug-ins, it's Input/Output image is variable. Thus the Input/Output memory allocation for modules in Slots (children) varies based on number of Plug-ins. 
Is it possible to fix the offset for each "Slot" (Child) with reference to Base I/O address of Device(Parent)?

It may be manufacturer dependent so what PLC are you using? If it is straight CoDeSys then you can try under the PLC configuration. Select the PLC and try not checking the Automatic calculation of Addresses. But I am still a little unclear what you are trying to accomplish and why? It seems you have a PLC configuration that you implemented in CODeSys and are now trying to expand it to a multitude of different configurations?
