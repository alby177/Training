Hello all,

Is there any documentation on the 3S CANOpen libraries:

3S_CanDrv.lib

3S_CanOpenManager.lib

3S_CanOpenDevice.lib

How can I aquire this information?

In the help file it states that there is a BUSDiag.lib? In my install I don't have this. Where can I get a copy?

Thanks

Hello

There is a document containing all information about the 3S CANopen stack called 'CanOpen for 3S runtimesystems.pdf'. But you only can get it if you are a customer or on demand.
I attached the BusDiag library and an example project for the CoDeSys SP RTE to this entry.

Bye, Frank Hailer

Thank you,

Yes, I did acquire this document. The last thing I was looking for was information on the implicit variables. I was told this would be available in February when service pack 5 is released?
