In the codesys program under the task configuration a POU can be set to Cyclic task, Event task and Freewheeling task. i am usually using the Cyclic task for my program but i didn't sure how to use the Freewheeling task and the Event task in a program. Please advise.

I mean in what condition that I have need to set a POU's task attribute to the Freewheeling and the Event task. Please advise.

You may use Cyclic if you have a task that is time sensitive like doing derivatives or integrating or calculating based on time. If you want the time to be pretty accurate for your calcualtions instead of doing a PLC cycle calculation each cycle for the task.

FreeWheeling means the code of the task is executed as fast as the PLC can execute code. I use this for all of my main control logic.

Event is just something that you only need to run when something happens that is not Cyclic and not freewheeling.
