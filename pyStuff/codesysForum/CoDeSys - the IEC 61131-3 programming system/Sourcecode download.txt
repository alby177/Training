CoDeSys has a sourcecode download feature. How to uplaod the sourcecode from the controller? Is this feature working with PlcWinNT?

Hello,

the download can be done implicitely in the menu online, or be configured for an automatic download in project/options/source code download.
You can upload the source from the controller by opening CoDeSys, execute the command open in the menu file and choose the option 'Open file project from PLC'. Then you will be asked for the target settings and the communication parameters and can open the source code directly from the PLC.

I just checked it with the PlcWinNT and it works perfectly.
