hi to everybody .
I would like to understand the following thing , i have a simple program i'm starting just now with the fantastic codesys .
In my program i have :
1) Main -Prg  ----> Structured text 
2) FB1          ----> Structured text

The FB1 is simple , it only has 2 input parameter declared in its table 
ADD1-----INT 
ADD2-----INT
and 1 output parameter 
SUM ------INT 
Difficult to understand that this FB get 2 integer numebers and calculate the sum and return it at output parameter .
Up to now doesn't matter .
In the Main-Prg i want to  call this FB1 .
So i write 

FB1(ADD1:=2,ADD2:=2,SUM=>myINT) ; //myINT is declared in the table as VAR .
In the VAR table of Main-Prg i declare also the instance for FB1 as follow:
DB_FB1 ---- FB1 .
I compile all but an event occours .
Normally , in the SCL (ST in simatic system) , when i call an FBxx i write 
dot "name of instance like this ----- FB1.DB_FB1(........,....,,....);
But codesys doesn't like of course.
If i use an other language in Main-Prg it's so easy to write the instance over the box , but in ST i don't understand what to do ....
Can somebody tell me the right solution ?
Thanks so much 
Walter

ok i have discovered 
To call the FB in ST it need to use the name of the instance and then pass the parameters
