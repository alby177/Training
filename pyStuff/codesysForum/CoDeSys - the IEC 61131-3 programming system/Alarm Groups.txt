Another day, another codesys question  Here goes:

I've got a visualization with an Alarm Table. When I configure this element I can change the alarm group. If I select a single alarm group (for instance: 'System/Main') there is no problem. However when I select 'All Alarm Groups' from the list 2 errors are generated during compiling:

'Error 4726: S500_Alarms (3): The alarm table for all alarm groups cannot be used because an old version of the library SysLibAlarmTrend is used'

'Error 4121: __S500_Alarms_Cyclecode (235): 'STPATH' is not a component of 'STAlarm'

Follow this link to see some screenshots:

I've tried Codesys versions: 2.3.9.19 and 2.3.9.20. 
I've tried different library versions: SysLibAlarmTrend.lib, SysLibAlarmTrend_V10.lib and SysLibAlarmTrend_V11.lib

Does anyone know that library? Is it commonly used much? Why do I need it? Is it possible for me to show multiple alarm groups in one alarm table?
