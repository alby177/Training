Hello,
could you help me with Codesys programming in ST. I would like to put e.g. velocity to analog output. 

c3.AnalogOutputDemandValue:=C3.statusSpeedDemandValue;

but the output is still 0V. Should I enable outputs in C3 Servomanager and set some extra scaling factors? 

Thank you very much. PepCa
