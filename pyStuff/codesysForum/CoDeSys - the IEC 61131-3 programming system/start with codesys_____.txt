hi shooterthank you for your guide...do you have any manual about how can use codesys or start work with codesys...thanks

the trafficsignal program is a big part of the help file, when you buy a codesys you can get a printed manual, however it is same as the help file.

hii love you " shooter " for your help..where is i go!!!my mail is : naeimi.programmable@gmail.com...

Hello Shooter,The same problem with me. I am trying to switch from Siemens Step7 to CoDeSys but it is hard without manual.If it is possible please share manual to my mail:dragan.grujicic@outlook.com.Best regards.

first try the helpfile within codesys,And the docs, that came with the PLC, as there are many PLC with a codesys core.Then you have to tell what version you want to learn, If V3 ask it in the appropriate Forum.then also download at www.oscat.de a nice library for any PLC.and yes i have several docs about 61131 and codesys.if you have any questions this forum will help you .
