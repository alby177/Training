Hi,

I am trying to change the preset of a timer on delay through an HMI.  I am doing everthing in simulation mode.  I can get to the part where  i click on the preset time to change it, and a  num pad will appear.  The problem is the preset time wont change when i hit ok on the numpad window.

Hi logix,

to change a value from type TIME you must use the keypad because you must type in the IEC format like T#5s500ms. If you want to change a time value by using the visualization i suggest 
1. use a INT variable
2. use in your Visualization this Variable
3. multiply the INT by 1000 (if you want to have seconds as unit)
4. use Typecast INT_TO_TIME
5. connect the result to the PT input of the timer

regards
Ralph
