Hi!
I am writting a "main" program (prgA) in SFC and each one of the actions of this diagram has an internal "subprogram" (sprgB) also in SFC. I want that prgA don't jump to the next step until the sprgB hasn't finished. 

The problem is that, during the transitions of sprgB, the main prgA jumps to the next step and, consequently, the sprgB is deactivated without having arrived to its goal. I solved this problem with a series of boolean variables that indicate if a process is active or not in order to be checked at the transitions of the main program.

But now the same problem seems to happen when I call a customized function block in the main program witten in ST and the subprogram is a SFC: the SFC only goes one step further (but not to the end) when I call it once.

Thanks for your help!

watch the conditions when to step and when block is completed.
make a global boolean to jump when step is dependend of more then one condition.
