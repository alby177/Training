Hello,I am working on a CAN diagnostic software tool that uses a PEAK PCAN USB network monitor as the interface into the CAN network. The software builds and compiles and I am able to login to the PLC (using the computer as a PLC for now). Im using 'CoDeSys_Control_Win_V3' runtime and have added a CANbus Device to my project. Upon logging in and selecting the Status Tab on the CANbus device, I see 'No driver found'. I'm guessing this is some sort of configuration issue or setting within my project that has to point to the PCAN USB driver installed on my computer. Can somebody tell me where the driver should be placed so that CoDeSys 3.5 could use it? Things I have done:    Confirmed the PCAN module is working correctly (read, write, and filter functions work as intended)    Added a CANbus deivce in CoDeSys    Started the PLC Control in the windows taskbar    Modified the CODESYSControl.cfg file in the installation directory\\GatewayPLC (uncommented Componenet.6=CmPUSBCanDrv)    Added the PCAN_USB.SYS file into \\GatewayPLC\Driver Folder. (was already there, but I over wrote it again)    Checked for no conflicting baud rates or node idsCANbus Device Information Tab:   Type 15   ID 181015   Version 3.5.4.0What am I missing?Thank You,   Vadim B.

Hi,if you use current CODESYS Version (V3.5.6.x) and you add[ComponentManager]Component.1=CmpTargetVisuStubComponent.2=CmpCodeMeterComponent.3=CmpWebServerComponent.4=CmpWebServerHandlerV3Component.5=CmpPCANBasicDrvto the "c:\Program Files\3S CODESYS\GatewayPLC\CODESYSControl.cfg" it will work like a charm Even using several Peak-USB adapter connected (several CAN bus) are possible and doing CAN View at the same time while the runtime is running will work. BREdwinPS: this is a CODESYS V3 question... will be moved to the CODESYSV3 section

Hello,I want to use my PEAK CAN USB dongle with 'CoDeSys Control Win V3'.I followed Edwin's instructions and added 'Component.5=CmpPCANBasicDrv' to '\\\GatewayPLC\CODESYSControl.cfg'.But when start my application, CANBus Status shows ' No driver found'.Is there anything I forgot?Next question: Is it possible to use PEAK CAN USB dongle with 'Condesys Control for Raspberry Pi'?Please help!Best regards,Oleg

Hi Oleg,please check on runtime startup (in the plc logger) ifCmpPCANBasicDrv component is loaded without error.PeakUSB with Pi:If you compile the Pi Linux kernel with socket can and enabled Peak USB modules, this should work.Maybe the Peak System Forum give here more details:http://www.peak-system.com/forum/viewto ... a&start=60BREdwin

I can't get this to work either using Codesys V3.5 SP9 Patch 2 (US) + for Control Win V3.Here is my CodesysControl.cfg[ComponentManager]Component.1=CmpTargetVisuStubComponent.2=CmpDynamicTextUSComponent.3=SysCpuMultiCoreComponent.4=CmpHilscherCIFXComponent.5=CmpPCANBasicDrv;Component.4=CmpBlkDrvCanServerThe log shows CAN0 (DEVICE_NUMBER = 0): NetID = 0       CmpPCANBasicDrvWhen I go online, the CANBus Status says "No driver found"This is just using the demo version, could this be why? Thanks,Travis

Hi, No should even work with demo version!Could you give us the whole loggerStart Control Win by console (run as admin) and /debug option for a test.BREdwin
