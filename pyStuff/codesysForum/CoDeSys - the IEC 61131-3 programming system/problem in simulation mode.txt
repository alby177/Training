Hi, I’m new in CoDeSys and I’m having problem with running program in simulation mode.When I build application with Project->Rebuild All, everything is compiled without errors. Then I choose Online->Simulation Mode and then Online->Login. Then I receive some build errors and can’t start simulation.I use MotionCenter (since we will use it for our project), which is CoDeSys 2.3 version of firm LTi. Configured hardware is also LTi Plc. Could it be the problem?I attached the project if you want to look at it.Thank's for any ideas,Dejan, Prague
