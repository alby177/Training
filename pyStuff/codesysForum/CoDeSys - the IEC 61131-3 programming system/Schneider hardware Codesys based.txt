Hello, Schneider have a new brand of hardware wich is programmed with a soft based in Cosesys 3.x.It's possible to program it directly with Codesys?One of new hard, is a hmi controler (with plc), wich have digital inputs and outputs integrated, and it can be upgraded with analog and more digital IO's. This HMI have an usb port, and I want to write directly from Codesys in a text file format. Do you know if it's possible?Thanks ins advance.Pau Torras

Thanks shooter, What is DDE?

Well, I have seen a manual about DDE.What I have seen, DEE is used to connect data with Excel or similar, that is'nt the thing I want.I want to write text files, (e.x. comma separated), directly to a pen usb attached to the usb HMI drive.It's possible?You can see some HMI properties in the link below:http://www.schneider-electric.com/docum ... itiati.pdfThanks,Pau
