i am using codesys v3.5 pbf, and have made a number of projects with this version of codesys   , i configured a Balluff...; now i can't seem to crack the simulation (activating inputs during simulation). please help   , explain every step in details, how i can successfully do this!Thank you   

go to the plc configuration here you can set the bools and inputs even in simulation.i use a xor on the visualisation as this makes simulation easier.
