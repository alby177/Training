I'm attempting to send e-mail alarms under Windows 7. Win7 doesn't include an SMTP service and Outlook gives the warning: A program is attemping to send e-mail on your behalf. I tried to disable the warning under the trust center in Outlook, but still get the warning box. Obviously, I can't have Windows 7/Outlook pop up a box everytime I need to send an e-mail.BTW, I wasn't able to send e-mail alerts without setting up Outlook. I'm really not sure why this is required. It would seem that Codesys would function as an e-mail 'client' and attempt a SMTP connection to the server specified in the Alarm Manager. After I installed Outlook, the e-mails showed up in Outlook's 'outbox' and they aren't forwarded to the SMTP server unless Outlook is running.So, how can I send e-mail alerts under Windows 7? Is there a recommended third party SMTP relay I can run on the local computer that works with Codesys? Do I have something misconfigured or what?[MORE INFO] I think I figured this out. Codesys makes calls to MAPI and doesn't send the mail directly with SMTP. The email client sends the mail, which is why you don't see any typical SMTP configuration items in Codesys. Only the server is specified. No ports, TLS, etc. So that's why Outlook needs to be configured and running. The pop up box is a result of Outlook security, which needs to be disabled with registry settings. Here's the URL as a reference. There are several posts that only have you change some of the settings. I had to make all the registry settings for Outlook 2007.http://blogs.msdn.com/b/nav/archive/201 ... ehalf.aspxNote: I will try Thunderbird, which provides a free implementation of SimplyMAPI. Hopefully, Codesys doesn't need extendedMAPI. I found this URL http://kb.mozillazine.org/MAPI_Support with more information.Thanks for your help.
