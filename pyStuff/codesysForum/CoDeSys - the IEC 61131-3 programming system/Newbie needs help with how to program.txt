Hi.

I have been trying the Trafficsignal program, with sequence and wait and all. I kind of get that, but what I want to make is:
A sensor for light/dark (analog output) and an on/off button.
The on/off button you can turn a light on/off, if in on mode for 30 minutes, the sensor will take over. If it's getting dark and output value gets below X, then a timer should start and if it stays dark enough during 10 minutes, the light should come on. Then it should stay on until it gets light again, or until 11:30pm.

I have no idea where to start or how to start. I am a complete newbie and these kind of technics are not really my cup of tea. So anyone, any idea? O, I use v2.3 of CoDeSys by ABB.

Anybody that can help with some of the parts??
If someone could just help me a little, I'll be probably on my way again.

use select (SEL) in a fiunction block program.
just start it as PLC_PRG as a function block program
put in a block press F2 and find SEL
put TRUE
on line 1
put value1 (fill in what you like)
put value2 same
ouput1 fill ib the blanks espesccially the port something like %QW0
and try to run it in simulation first.
