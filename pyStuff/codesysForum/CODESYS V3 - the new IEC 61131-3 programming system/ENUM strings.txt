Hi,I have a simple ENUM definition:Code:TYPE Data :(Data1,Data2,Data3);END_TYPEData1 is equal number 0, Data2 is equal number 1 etc...My question is:How can I get strings from ENUM data? For example - I like to get string Data1 in string variable (using number 0). Is it possible to get this in Codesys?Thank you!Best regards, Zdenko.

No this is not possible (or at least it was not possible when I last checked).What you could do is add text lists and place the text in these lists. From the application you can read these lists.See http://forum.codesys.com/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=5955The advantage is that you could translate these text lists for use in other languages.

Thank you very much! This is helpful!Best regards,Zdenko.
