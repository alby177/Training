Hi all, I'm trying to read informations stored in the Alarm Storage database via code.The 'Read' operation is returning the value 30402 but I have no idea about what it means!If you look in the documentation you'll find:Quote:ENUM EAlarmStorageReaderErrorsThis enumeration defines the errors, that can occur during accessing the alarm storage using the public interface. Note: Error codes from 30400 to 30549 represent errors from the underlying CAA Storage component. See STO.ERROR But in the CAA Storage library I can't find any kind of informations (see attachements).Any solution?
