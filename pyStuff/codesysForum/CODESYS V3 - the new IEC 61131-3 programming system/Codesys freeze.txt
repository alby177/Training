Codesys freeze at start, if norton internet security enabled (codesys&codemeter has acces to internet). After this it impossible to kill process codesys.

I only heard of this once after upgrading from 3.5.x.x to 3.5.4.x.It was related to the codemeter.exe which handles the license management.When they removed codemeter it was solved, but probably it was related to the empty softlicensecontainer.See the following release information of CODESYS 3.5 SP4:Tools / License Manager in CODESYS:The license manager user interface integrated in CODESYS versions before V3.5 SP4 will no longer workcorrectly after installing 3.5 SP4. The licenses themselves are not affected and will still work.(The reason for this misbehavior is the installation of an empty Soft­license­container for usage withCODESYS Control Win V3 resp. RTE V3, which is not recognized correctly.)The possible workarounds to use the integrated user interface to the CodeMeter license manager are:­ Use the license manager of V3.5 SP4. (Recommended!)­ In rare cases where usage of the license manager of a CODESYS version before V3.5 SP4 is definitely required: Remove the empty soft­license container using CodeMeter control center.
