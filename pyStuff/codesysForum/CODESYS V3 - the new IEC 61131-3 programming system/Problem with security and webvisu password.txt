Hi,I'm working with Codesys 3.5 and Raspberry pi. I have created a project and everything was working fine until I got curious and went to the security menu and added a online user. It has become a nightmare afterwards. Every time I want to make a change and login to the device it asks me to login as a user and if I launch the webvisu from any device a login display is showing and I need to login with my user and password.I have searched the forum for similar problem and found this one: viewtopic.php?t=5667#p10173which helped me to remove the password from the user but still I need to login with the password less user.What I need is to completely remove the login page showing up. I've searched a lot and tried to find what I need to do but could not find a solution  The documentation for the user management is not really helpful either! I appreciate any input that can help me regarding this problem.
