Hi All,I am hardly looking for a way to “customize” Modbus offsets in a Modbus Serial Device Object.Here my Codesys device is Modbus serial slave.The problem that I’m experiencing is that  there is no available field dedicated to set the Modbus offsets in the mapping table.I know that it is possible in devices such as Eurotherm LIN instruments for example, for those who know these!In these devices, we are able to define modbus offsets without any consideration of the function code, reading or writing access.Is there a way to do that in Codesys devices ?In other words, I would like to be able to put an input register at the offset 723 in the modbus serial device mapping table, even if it is the only register.Thanks for your help!Fred.
