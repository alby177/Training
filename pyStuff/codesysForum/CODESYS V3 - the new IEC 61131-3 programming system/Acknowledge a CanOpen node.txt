When an EMCYmessage is detected on a CanOpen node, it is possible, in on-line mode, to see the Emcy code and to acknowledge the node by the button acknowledge located in the device tab "status". It's possible to read the Emcy Code with the  function RECV_EMCY of the CAA CIA 405 library but Is anyone know how to ack a node directly from the PlcApplication    ? Thanks  

I had the same question and got the following answer from 3S-Software Support:Emergencies cannot be acknowledged by the application. You can only check which Emergencies are pending. For this, use the CiA405 RECV_EMCY and RECV_EMCY_DEV functionblock.PS, I also asked about the CANOpen manager buttons in the status window to start/stop/reset/... a node, because this didn't work. Here the answer:The buttons are only for the CANopenManagerFDT and will be deactivate in future versions, if FDT is not activated.By the way, I had a project with 18 nodes and had to set the guard time of all nodes pretty high (5000ms) to get it to work correctly, but I don't know if it is CoDeSys related or Slave related. What is your experience?

Thanks for your contribution TimvH.Concerning the acknowledge of the CanOpen nodes , the support now gave me the same answer as you. I have to check again but i've seen that until i didn't ack the node, the EMCY function memorize the last emergency code/node in error. Therefore, view from the plc application, i still have a node in error ...this is my problem, i would like either akc the node or ack the Emcy function from the plc app.About my experience, in my current project, i have 11 nodes and i use heartbeat function instead of node guard (it's better but, of course, it has to be supported by the devices). My heatbeat producer time is 200ms and consumer time 300ms. I don't have problem with this function Best regards
