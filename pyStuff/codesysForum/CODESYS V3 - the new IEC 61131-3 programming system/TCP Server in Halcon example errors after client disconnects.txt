Hello,Setup: Schneider Electric TM251MESE running the TCP-Server codeWith putty I connect to this plc with raw tcp communication on port 4711.The plc response is Hello World: 100When I response with Hello World: 100 the response is Hello World: 99 etc.As expected the value decrements every time the correct response is send back to the plc The eState variable is switching from Init to Send to Read, Send, Read... After I close the putty window the state switches to Error then to Init, assuming this is expected behaviour.When I try to connect again the connection is made, the Hello World: __ string is returned and eState switches to Read.The next cycle handling this state fails:The putty window closes.Setting breakpoints: after executingCode:TCPRead(xEnable:= TRUE, hConnection:= Connection, szSize:= SIZEOF(sReceived), pData:= ADR(sReceived));TCPRead.xError is true, eState switches from Error into Init.Every time I connect again the Hello World: __ string is send again but every attempt to receive (TCPRead) results in an Error then Init.Only by a cold reset I can connect again and send data back to the plc. What is happening?Is there a method to reset the functionblocks in this example?I tried this example as I need to implement a connection from a robot to this plc.Are there any other examples of a simple tcp-server arround with some error handling?Thanks in advance!Best regards,Onno
