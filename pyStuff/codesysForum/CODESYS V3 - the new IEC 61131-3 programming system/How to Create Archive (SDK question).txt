Ive looked at the SDK help file, and Im trying to figure out how to make an instance of "_3S.CoDeSys.ProjectArchive.IProjectArchiveService"so I can Archive the currently loaded project.Can some one help or send me an example.Ive tried the following, which didnt work (C#)var archiveService = ComponentManager.Singleton.InstanceFactory.GetSystemInstance(typeof(_3S.CoDeSys.ProjectArchive.IProjectArchiveService).FullName);

Hi BobbieB.There is no system instance for IProjectArchiveService in CODESYS. You have to create your own instance of the "service" with CreateInstance(). For CODESYS V3.5 SP5 or older:Code:IProjectArchiveService pas = (IProjectArchiveService)ComponentManager.Singleton.CreateInstance(new Guid("{F23B52AD-F5EC-4785-BC13-F1FB7F998DB5}"));For CODESYS V3.5 SP6 or newer:Code:IProjectArchiveService pas = ComponentManager.Singleton.CreateInstance<IProjectArchiveService>(new Guid("{F23B52AD-F5EC-4785-BC13-F1FB7F998DB5}"));BRMartin
