Hi all,When I try to start CODESYS it shows me this message:What can I do to fix this?

Hi,could you check c:\ProgramData\CODESYS\for the following three opt files:CODESYS.opt CODESYSProjectDefaults.opt CoDeSysUser.opt I could not reproduce this, when I delete the opt file this does not happen with my Installation.Could you please execute CODESYS by the DiagnosisTool and give me the log"c:\Program Files (x86)\3S CODESYS\CODESYS\Common\DiagnosisToolLauncher.exe" How to use it:- Start the Diagnosis Tool Launcher.- Enter the path of the executable to be monitored (the "debuggee").- Optionally, enter command line arguments for the debuggee.- Click "Run process".The application will start as usual; tracing will begin immediately. When thedebuggee is terminated (no matter whether regularly or irregularly), theDiagnosis Tool Launcher will prompt the user whether and where to save thecorresponding logfile.ADVANCED ACTIONS"Quit process":A termination request is sent to the debuggee. This is exactly the same asclicking the main window's top-right X button of the debuggee."Kill process":The debuggee process is killed immediately. This action might be necessary ifdebuggee process is hanging within an endless loop."Add marker...":This can be used to add additional comments into the logfile. For example, youcould add a marker called "Compiling the project" just before doing so in thedebuggee process. This way it is easier to find "synchronization points" in thelogfile; the person which evaluates a logfile can get a clearer imagination ofwhich logfile entries correspond to a certain user action."View...":The logfile recorded so far is viewed in a standard editor."Save...":The logfile recorded so far is saved to disk. Note that the user is anywayautomatically prompted to save the logfile whenever the debuggee process isterminated.BR Edwin

I deleted the three .opt files and then CODESYS was able to start.But I didn't have any views. I had to manually add all the views.But it seems to work fine now.Thank you.
