Hi,I have to create a FB in ST as a continuous loop but I have no idea how to realize this?Regards,Malcolm

What you mean by "Continuous loop" ?

Hi mbruck,I mean a finite loop just like a for-loop.Regards,Malcolm

Here's my solution. I think it could be less difficult but it works 

Enable should not be an input as you are using it as an output in the program: Enable:= falseas long as PLC_PRG runs your loop will be processed.please never never stay in a loop, as the watchdog will be alarmed.
