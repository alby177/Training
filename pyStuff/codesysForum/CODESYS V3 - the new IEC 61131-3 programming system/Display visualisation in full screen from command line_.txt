Hi,I wonder if it's possible to open a project in Codesys 3.5, logon to the PLC, and display a particular visualisation in full screen, without a menu bar or toolbars - all this from command line, as I want to do it automatically when a PC starts.Thanks

You can use the HMI for this.

"C:\Program Files\Internet Explorer\IEXPLORE.EXE"  -k http://192.168.2.201/plc/webvisu.htmthe letter -k makes it full display, look it up for your explorer.you must have java installed.
