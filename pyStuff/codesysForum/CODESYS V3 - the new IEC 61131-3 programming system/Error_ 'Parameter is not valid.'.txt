Hi,I'm writing a test app for an Eaton XV300 CoDeSys HMI (3.5.5) and everything was going well until recently, when I started getting a 'Parameter is not valid' error on download. The program compiles and downloads into the HMI (or Simulation) and then triggers the error with 'Creating HTML files for Web-Visualizarion: WebVisualization' shown on the status bar at the bottom.Unfortunately it was after many changes, and I don't know which parameter is invalid!, and stupidly I don't have an earlier backup as it's a test project.Is there a build log file somewhere which gives additional information as to the parameter which is not valid as the error message is of absolutely no use in tracking down the issue.Any input would be appreciated.Thanks,PJE[Update]I created a fresh project and copied each element from the original project to the new one. After many build cycles I managed to find the bad item - one of the visualization screens - and made a new version. My application now builds and downloads without an error.It would still be nice to have been told what was wrong!
