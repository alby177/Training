One of our Unity PLC's have to read data from an ABB PLC.The protocol is Modbus TCP-IP.The addressing methods of the PLCs are different.I am not sure about :The byte order inside a word,The bit order inside a byte and inside a word.Please look at the examples and confirm or correct.The ABB word %mw0.100 contains two bytes %mb0.200 and %mb0.201. The byte with the lower address is the Most Significant Byte.This ABB word %mw0.100 is equivalent to MODICON word 400101.If this is true so :The bit %mx0.201.0 is the Least Significant Bit of %mw0.100 and 400101. And the %mx200.15 is the MSB of %mw0.100 and 400101.I have no access to the ABB code.Please excuse my poor english.Please help,Robert
