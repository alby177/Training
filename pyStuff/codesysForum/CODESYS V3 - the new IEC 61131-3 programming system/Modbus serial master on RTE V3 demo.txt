Hello,I'm trying to check the possibilty of susbstituting my old solution with RTE running on a PC. I need RTE the to exchange data with several modbus slaves connected to the serial ports of the PC. There are 3 ports and then about 10 different slaves connected to each port. I've added the com ports and assigned modbus masters to them in my Devices tree, but I can't find any modbus function. I've tried and searched the library manager, there were no results, so I assumed that the modbus library is in an additional package, am I right? Here http://www.3s-software.com/index.shtml?en_modbus_lib&sitesearchmatch=modbus#sitesearchmatch   it says, that there's no modbus serial master library at all. Why is it then possible to add a modbus master com port device? Is there something like a demo modbus library that I could test?

You don't need a library to access the slaves.You only need to add them to your Master (Modbus_COM => Modbus_Master => Modbus_Slave(s)).In the Slave configuration you can specify the slave address and Modbus Registers you want to read/write.PS, for the slaves, automatically implicit variables are created.E.g. Modbus_Slave_COM_Port.xError (Modbus_Slave_COM_Port is the name of the slave in the Device Tree).Automatically a library will be added, but this is hidden and you don't need it to get communication.

Thank you a lot!Could you please tell me if there's any way to check in the programm the status of the communication with a modbus slave?

<ModbusSlaveDeviceName>.xError to see is there is a communication error.<ModbusSlaveDeviceName>.xReset to reset the error and start communication again.<ModbusSlaveDeviceName>.byModbusError gives information about the error.In the Modbus library is a Struct "MB_ErrorCodes" which gives you the information about the errors.For advanced users:Through the menu: Tools=> Options =>Feature sets, you can specify that you don't want to hide System Libraries.Here you can see the information of the Struct.
