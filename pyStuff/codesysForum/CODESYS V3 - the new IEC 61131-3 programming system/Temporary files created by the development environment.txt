Dear All - maybe a lame question:I'm using SVN in some cases, but smaller projects, and quick interactions doesn't allow this...In a regular project I'm normally cooperating via Google Drive, or Dropbox (this includes electrical drawings, other config files, architecctural drawings... A lot). The easiest way could be for me to simply save my project to a Google Drive locally "mirrored" folder, ensuring automatic, consistent backup (My usual way, is to save the project with a filename containing the version, like CustomerProject_0A12, or CustomerProject_0A12_20150612_boot). Naturally I create complete project archives as needed.But... where I save the project, quite large compile, symbol... and other temporary files are created, I don't really want these to take cloud space.By the way it's eating up a lot of space from my notebook storage as well....Is there a simple way to configure CODESYS to store these "compile" files in a separate, temporary folder, not backed up to the cloud, and to be erased regularly?
