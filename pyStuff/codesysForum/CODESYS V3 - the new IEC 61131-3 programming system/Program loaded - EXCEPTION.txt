Hello,I have this situation: I have downloaded Codesys 3.5SP7 and installed it following all the indicated steps.I have tried to run a very simple program indicated here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tX6gumm2zgWhen I Build it there are no errors. When I login in Simulation mode I can not simulate the program, as it indicates Program loaded - EXCEPTION.I have attached the image of what Codesys indicates.Apparently there is an error: Licence File Missing. What should I do about this?

It is not the error which is the problem, but the exception.There is an access violation from the visu_task.What I would do is, go offline, do a "clean all" and then download the application again. Hopefully this solves it.If not, check your visualization.

Hello,Thank you for your answer.I have done this few times and have the same reaction.Could have any effect the fact that I use Windows 10?

Hi,thanks for your answer.Follow these same steps, but my problem continues, with the following messages:"The Visualization could not be registered in the runtime, reason: Internal Error: An invalid external identification was given"and"The method Connect must not be called on the VisuOnTargetConnectingState"Can you help me?

Hi,add VISU_NO_EXCEPTION_HANDLINGas Compiler define (rightclick on application -> Properties->Built -> Compilerdefine) will solve this.This is an accident and does at the moment occure in current Version.If you login to Control Win as real plc it does not occure.BREdwin

It worked, thank you!

Faced the same problem.Solution worked for me also.Small addition you have to add this with every new project? or can you permanent add this?

Works like a charm...but I don't know if it's permanent or not

Dear Esse,For every new project you have to enter that, but if you have entered it to a project it stays there. If you save and restart the proiject it is still in placeit works fine for me

Hello,It works fine for me too.Thank you.
