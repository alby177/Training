Hi guys,I just started using codesys and I am currently struggling with the AlarmManager / Alarm table feature (Codesys V3.5.11.4).1.- Alarm Table / Properties / Variable For Selected Alarm ID: it does not update its value when an alarm is selected. I have tried with "Variable For Selected Alarm Group" and it works, however, it does not work with the Alarm ID. I am trying to create an action when an alarm is selected on the alarm table and this would allow me to do it. Do I have to enable any feature 2.- Alarm Configuration / Alarm Group / Message: I am trying to use "Latch Var 1" within the alarm message (e.g. <LATCH1> Low) but it does not includes the Latch1 value into the message. This was working when I was using  Codesys Control for Raspberry Pi SL but it stopped working since I update the device to Win V3.  Is this feature not enabled when using Win V3 ? Is it other way to update the alarm message?Thank you in advance  

Hi, you could check this example:https://store.codesys.com/alarm-manager.htmlIf you change to Control Win - login to the real device (on your pc) do not use it in simulation.Regardsplcmax

Hi plcmax,Thank you for your comment, it solved issue nº 2. However, issue nº1 is still ON. I don´t fully understand why it does not update this value if this is an option of the "Alarm Table".Thank you again.
