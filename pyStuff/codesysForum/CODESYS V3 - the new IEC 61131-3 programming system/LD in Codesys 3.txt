I had a couple of questions related to LD features from 2.3 that seem not to be available in in codesys 3:
1) When will option 'Networks with line breaks' be available?
2) Why is it not possible have function blocks in parallel rungs?

Thanks

The required feature (networks with line breaks and parallel networks) is scheduled for the next CoDeSys version (V3.4).

Is there an estimated timeline for version v3.4?

CoDeSys V3.4 is scheduled for spring 2010.

I download the V3.4 and i note that in LD editor there ins't option "add/remove EN/ENO" when i insert box  but in version 3.3 this option there was.
In the online help of V3.4 there is the description of this option but i can't found it.

Best Regards .
Stefano
