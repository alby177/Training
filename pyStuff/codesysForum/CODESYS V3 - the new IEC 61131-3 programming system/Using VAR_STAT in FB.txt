Hi everybody,I'm founding some problems with the VAR_STAT in the function block: I don't understand why the variables that I declare in the VAR_STAT field are set to 0 everytime that the function block is called. I tried to not initialized the variables but nothing happens, do I have to set something else?I saw that if I use the VAR type I obtain the result that I want but why it should be like this?

As I understand VAR variables declared in the main FB body are already static.  I'm not sure how VAR_STAT is interpreted in the main body, but it probably ends up being something like a class variable, where it's the one and same variable for all instances of the FB.  Try incrementing a VAR_STAT variable on the first execution of the block to see if it counts the number of instances.I believe that if you use VAR_STAT in  a method or a function  then you would get the expected behavior.

I will try to increment a VAR_STAT variable when I will have time to do that test.
