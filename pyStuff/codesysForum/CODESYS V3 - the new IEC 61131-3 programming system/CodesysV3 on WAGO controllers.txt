Hello,I think CodeSysV3 is used in e!cockpit (new development enviroment for WAGO controllers)I am completely new to this.Need to achieve:STRING variable containing sensitive data being sent to another system to be encrypted with AES-256I know WAGO do not have library supporting thisAnyone knows if it is possible to write FB with use of some higher level language (C, C++, Python etc)They have already libraries to handle this.Also I need WAGO to be OPC client. In WAGO only one way is to get proper library from WAGO (they do not have this yet)?Or there is any chance to somehow get it incorporated from CodeSys?Thank you for helpMarcin
