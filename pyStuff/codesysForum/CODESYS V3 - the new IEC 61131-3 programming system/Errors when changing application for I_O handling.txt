Hello,I am using CODESYS Control Win V3 andCODESYS V3.5 SP4 Patch 4I am developing an application that controls a process and communicates with a remote ModbusTCP slave I/O module. My project has an application named "Application" for testing the I/O configuration and this works just fine. The project has a device tree with Ethernet/Modbus_TCP_Master/Modbus_TCP_Slave elements. I/O mapping under the slave device maps Modbus data to global variables (e.g. DI_00) visible to the "Application" by notation "Application.DI_00", etc... Problem is that I can not change the I/O handling application to any other application. My "OtherApplication" builds fine, but when I make it the I/O handling application and try to build, I get nasty error messages. Before building, I exclude the "Application's" slave device from build and include to build another slave device, with mappings to "OtherApplication's" variables like "OtherApplication.DI_00". The error messages I get are here:*** clip/ *************************                ------ Build started: Application: WP_PLC.OtherApplication -------                typify code ...[ERROR]         WP_HPP_ControlSystem: C0032:  Cannot convert type 'Unknown type: 'ADR(GVL_Io_9ea12d66_edff_4fcf_b518_cc89e3cfc2a8_HPS_2.Io_9ea12d66_edff_4fcf_b518_cc89e3cfc2a8_HPS_2)'' to type 'POINTER TO IoConfigParameter'[ERROR]         WP_HPP_ControlSystem: C0077:  Unknown type: 'GVL_Io_9ea12d66_edff_4fcf_b518_cc89e3cfc2a8_HPS_2.Io_9ea12d66_edff_4fcf_b518_cc89e3cfc2a8_HPS_2'[ERROR]         WP_HPP_ControlSystem: C0046:  Identifier 'GVL_Io_9ea12d66_edff_4fcf_b518_cc89e3cfc2a8_HPS_2' not defined                Compile complete -- 3 errors, 0 warnings*** /clip *************************What am I doing wrong?BR,JukkaP
