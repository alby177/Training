I have a few applications running on the same plc. An opc client is reading and writing to these. As long as this client is connected I cannot login to the application. I get the error "Connection denied by device: All available communication channels are already in use"How can i get around this?

Hi,Depending which plc you are using this is either a define on compile (runtime) or a setting in the CODESYSCONTROL.cfgBREdwin

Thanks for the reply.I am using the soft plc that comes with the standard codesys setup. Could you specify which setting it is in the CodesysControl.cfg file. I cannot identify it by looking at the file.Thanks

Does any one know the setting name?

Hi,sure then you need to add in CODESYSControl.cfg the following section:[CmpChannelServer]Buffersize=1600000MaxChannels=8BREdwin

Thanks for that. That works great.One follow up question is that I have a cfg file for every version of codesys that I have installed. Is it just sufficient to add this to CodesysControl.cfg . Does the version specific cfg overwrite the settings in the base CodesysControl.cfgThanks
