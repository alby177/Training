HiOn several ooccasions Codesys has crashed mid way through an operation, and after restarting Codesys crashed on startup ( on 2 different computers ). Each time I have had to completely remove Codesys and rebuilt it which is a real pain. Spent a lot of time reseacrchinh the error codes but none of the measures I have complete seem to stop this. Has anyone else had experience of this and can anyone suggest how to solve it without reinstalling and reconfiguring?Problem signature:  Problem Event Name:	APPCRASH  Application Name:	CODESYS.exe  Application Version:	3.5.9.0  Application Timestamp:	578f7534  Fault Module Name:	StackHash_0a9e  Fault Module Version:	0.0.0.0  Fault Module Timestamp:	00000000  Exception Code:	c0000005  Exception Offset:	00000000  OS Version:	6.1.7601.2.1.0.256.1  Locale ID:	2057  Additional Information 1:	0a9e  Additional Information 2:	0a9e372d3b4ad19135b953a78882e789  Additional Information 3:	0a9e  Additional Information 4:	0a9e372d3b4ad19135b953a78882e789
