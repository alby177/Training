Hey All,I looked at some other posts regarding documentation for library, and it looks like you have to manually generate it. However, this video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4lQGWAUTgs&t=1s) shows that the documentation is automatically generated after she clicked the "Save Project And Install Into Library Repository". I tried to follow the steps, but library always end up with "This object has no documentation." Anyone can shed some light on this matter?Thanks,

The link you posted is definitely different from what I was watching. I'll look into this for more information.Thanks!

Hi Edwin,I watched the video multiple times and followed the steps. However, when I install the library, same deal. I get this "This object has no documentation." I included .library instead of compiled-library, so I hope this didn't screw up the process.The .chm file is in "C:\Program Files (x86)\3S CODESYS\CODESYS\Online Help\en"I can look at the description in the Online Help (F1 key), but nothing shows up at Library Manager level. Not sure what's going on here.Thanks,

Thought I was going crazy here.

Thank you for this information.After several days of struggling, I just opened forum to post new topic and then I saw this.I also thought I was going crazy.
