HiI have a "Test Manager" plugin installed which requires a USB licence dongle and sometimes I have to remove the USB key,but still I want to use some codesys.exe with scripts (which do not require this plugin).To solve this problem I found this "--skipunlicencedplugins" exe parameter but seems that it is not working (v3.5 SP6).Are there any additional parameters required? Or is this not supported (just documented) yet?Thanks

Hi.You have a typo in your parameter. The correct one is "--skipunlicensedplugins".BRMartin

Thank you I will check it out, but if that is valid than its a documentation issue.Latest help gave me the hint that I should use this parameter:Code:ExampleCODESYS.exe --skipunlicencedplugins

Hi etamgul.You are right. It's an error in the documentation. I told my colleague and he fixed it. In the next release of CODESYS the help will contain the correct notation.BRMartin
