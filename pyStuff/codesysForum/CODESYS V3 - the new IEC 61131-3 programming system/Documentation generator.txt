Hello,I'd like to know if there is any way to use a documentation generator with codesys (like Doxygen?).This could be very handful for documenting code that is rather large or complex...Thanks!

You can use the menu item: Project => Document.This generates a document of your project.Is this what you mean?

What I mean is more something like Doxygen.It automatically generates documentation, not only doing a "print out" of the project.Thanks for answering tho.Any other ideas ?

Perhaps exporting the project into PLCopenXML format and then having some parser to Doxygen would be an alternative? I have never used Doxygen so I'm not sure what it's capable of. Also, it's not possible to get all the project information to PLCopenXML.
