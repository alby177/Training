I've created a Table with 2 columns:1.st column is showing my BOOL array of inputs, configured with template for color variable, WORKS OK2.nd column should be showing my Text list with corresponding ID range from 1 to 8. But i cannot configure damn Text index!The point of that. I have 64 Digital inputs (8x BOOL arrays size 8 ), want to show them in diagnosis screen, it is a lot of work to do with descriptions in 3 different languages. So this can be simply solved with Text list and language switching.Can anyone advice me how to do that?attached pic of problemTnx in advanceAlex

How would you like to show 8 different values depending on a BOOL state?If this would be an array of integers, you could use as text index the declaration: aiIn[INDEX]

No, I would only like to show fixed descriptions undependent of BOOL state!

If ad add a axIn8[INDEX], i get value form Text list only where primariy array is TRUE (pic attached) because value is always 1.

I figured out a workaround with one support array://Workaround for filling table with text list, support array	auiTextList8  : ARRAY[1..8] OF UINT:=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8];So, I put in Text index field: 	auiTextList8[INDEX]result is OK, attached picbrut force solution, but works... any other easier way suggested?regards,Alex

Hi Alex,Yes, that is how I would also do it if you want to be able to easily translate the texts.
