Hello!Does anybody have an IDEA how could I retrieve text from TextList in my programm?I have a list, for example:0:a2:b54:ci saw function DynamicTextGetText, but I have no idea how to use it. It always returns '';Thank you!

up

It returns nothing if no language has been selected yet.If you want to get the "default" text, then use:Code:VisuElems.cmpDynamictext.DynamicTextGetDefaultText(ADR(sTextList), ADR(sTextListID))^If the user has selected a language, or if this is set in the application you can use:Code:VisuElems.cmpDynamictext.DynamicTextGetText(ADR(sTextList), ADR(sTextListID))^What you can do is remember the latest selected language and load that at the start of the application.Code:// At start-up: initialise the actual language with the last selected languageIF xInit THEN   visuElems.CURRENTLANGUAGE := gvlPersistent.sSelectedLanguage;   xInit := FALSE;END_IF// Remember the selected language (if it is changed it needs to be activated again during start-up)gvlPersistent.sSelectedLanguage := visuElems.CURRENTLANGUAGE;

Thank you for your response!

Does somebody have an programing example, how to use DynamicTextGetText, because it dont Work for me.

Try this one

Does anybody know, if it's possible to retrieve Text from enums with textlist Support? The data is also saved as .txt file, but in UTF-8 which doesn't work with "DynamicTextGetText" etc..

Yes, I tried this one. The Problem is, that the file coding differs from "normal" text list (utf-8 / ANSI).It seems that UTF-8 isn't working with DynamicTextGet... My solution is to read it manually with FileOpen/FileGets (According to the CSV reader example).Thanks for your support
