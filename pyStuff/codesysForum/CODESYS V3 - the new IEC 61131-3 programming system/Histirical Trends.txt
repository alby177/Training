Hello,I need to include a temperature trend recorder visualisation into my CoDeSys 3 project for display on a 15" touch screen HMI. The trend needs to be able to show the temperature at any time in the last 3 days. The following standard basic features are needed:The sample time for the temperature must be once every 15 secondsThe displayed trend length must be operator adjustable from 1Hr to 3 days.The sample time and date must displayed along the x axisThe operator must be able to scroll the x axis within the available data.I assumed that 'Trace' would do all this but I am unable to find any way to implement these features that are normally included as standard on other HMIs.Any advise would be gratefully received

In V3.5 SP5 the (historical) Trend is added as additional visualization object.This is what you need and not the Trace.Probably you are using an older CODESYS version.The Trend can store data in sqlite files and retrieve it. Please check if your device supports this functionality.
