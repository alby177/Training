HelloWe started to backup our "CODESYS Control for PFC 200 SL" licences by saving the WibuCmRaU-files naming it after the ticket number.Now I made a mistake and I licensed a controller by using the first option "license activate".How can I get now the WibuCmRaU-file? When I enter the ticket number at the licensing hompage "license.codesys.com" it only says, that the license is already activated on the controller (see appendix "MyLicenses").I know that it is also possible to save the 3SLicenseInfo.tar file from the controller, but we dont want to have several kinds of backups.What possibility I have now to receive the WibuCmRaU-file?

Hi,please ask this question in the Store Helpdesk, you could then send the ticket number of the licenseand get back the license update file for your device.How to ask support questions in the embedded helpdesk of your store?	1. Login to the store (account is needed)	2. Generate a  new request 'My Question'	3. Submit your request	4. Then select 'Support Tickets'	5. Add all needed details information to your request in case of licensing issues do not forget the ticketnumber in case of bug reports:	• Version of the CODESYS development environment	• Version, operating system and processor of the target system	• Attach Project archive (not just the CODESYS project!)	• Steps to repeatBREdwin
