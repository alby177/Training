I have a project where I’m generating data in PLCopen XML-format. I want to import the data into CODESYS V3 and have managed to do that successfully for most of the data. I have though encountered a problem when my data is representing a certain kind of branched connection. CODESYS is unable to import the POU and I receive the error message: “Creation of object ‘POU_name’ failed. Reason: The given key was not present in the dictionary.”What is the meaning of this error message and how can I resolve the problem? Is there something wrong with my input data or is this kind of branched connection forbidden in CODESYS? Currently I use CODESYS V3.5 SP6 Patch 1.I made a small example that includes the kind of branched connection that is causing the problem. The PLCopen XML-data can be found attached.Thanks in advance!
