HelloI've been given an EDS file to talk to a Kawasaki robot controller.It installs ok, but only Input data seems visible.If I install it in another Ethernet/IP configurator (Omron) then Input and Output data appears.Could anyone have a look? (I've changed extension from eds to txt to upload it here)Thanks

Anyway, I've attached the updated EDS. Let me know how it works.

That's really kind. I'm visiting Kawasaki next week to try and make this work. I'll certainly let you know.

Hi.Just to let you know this this worked.I really appreciate your help. Kudos to you for spotting the error.Regards, Paul
