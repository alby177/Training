Hello,We are working on a CANopen project.We want to read the bus load of CAN1I use the CAA Can Low Level Extern library (Namespace CL2)For most function i need an CAA.HANDLEI gues that i can get this handle by using the Function DriverOpenH from the CL2 namespace.But when i use that function it request an input ctMessages (CAA.COUNT) I cannot find where i can get this CAA.COUNT.Has somebody an idea where to find this input. Or a different way of analizing the CANopen bus.Best regards Patrick

You have to specify from which library you will get the COUNT type.Since 3.5 this has been changed (compared to 3.4).Please use CL2.COUNT instead of CAA.COUNT.

Thanks Tim, Problem has been solved.regards
