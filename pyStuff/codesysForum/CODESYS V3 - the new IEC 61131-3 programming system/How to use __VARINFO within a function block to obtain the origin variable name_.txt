I know how to use __VARINFO to obtain the symbol name of a variable or object, but I have a problem with it.I would like a function block to obtain the symbol name of the variable that was used as input to it.Obviously, if I use __VARINFO I will only get the local pin name, not the symbol name of the variable that is actually connected to the pin outside of the block.The same problem occurs when I loop through my EtherCAT nodes using pointers and dereferencing.Obviously I'm not able to obtain the symbolic name of the node, only the symbolic name of the pointer.Suggestions anyone? Or is this a dead end?
