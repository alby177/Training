hello,

I'd like to use object oriented programming for industrial automation. However I have a problem to find some hardware compatible with V3. Can anybody recommend ???

Does V3 support BaR hardware ???

As we have no updated information on which of our customers already offer CoDeSys V3 devices, we can so far only relate to the reference list. On the other hand the number of customers that are working on such devices and already announced them is increasingly rising.

Please understand that we cannot list an excerpt of them here  . We have to list them all - or leave it. At the moment the number of available devices with CoDeSys V3 should be at least 20 or 30. Using Google might at least give you an idea about it.

Wago 'Speedway' have V3.

http://www.wago.us/products/680.htm

Hitachi has developed the new EHV+ CPU.
Programmable with CoDeSys V3.
Compatible with existing EH-150 modules.

Schneider Electric is developing an entire line of PLC's based on CoDeSys V3 with an OEM software called SoMachine.

These PLC's include everything from HMI-based, VFD-based, low-end, high-end, and motion-based.

Full Disclosure: I work for Schneider Electric and I love CoDeSys!  

The new Bosch Rexroth controllers (ones ending in 5 such as L25, L45, L65) use Indraworks Version 10 which is based on V3. 

My disclosure: I work for a Bosch Rexroth Distributorand like CoDeSys very well.

Hey - that is really good! 

We are really pleased that you list your CoDeSys V3 programmable controller here. So please go on - the world is waiting for them  !

So my experiences after 4 months of looking for Codesys V3 hardware:(I'm looking for standard supported HW with Codesys V3 - OOP needed !)- the list of references of Codesys is long but it has very few Codesys V3 OEM manufacturers in fact; a lot of listed companies look more like service provider than HW manufacturer i.e. they provided automation services and use Codesys for their own use only;- I have contacted via email circa 20 HW manufacturers that look like a standard HW manufacturer- I've got only few responses;- I limited the list of HW manufacturers to big companies with some reputation and world (or at least Europe)-wide coverage- the status of V3 implementation in these companies is not good:BECKHOFF:- V3: new Twincat - summer 2010, no more info now...SCHNEIDER:- V3: Somachine: visualization is NOT Codesys, only usuall system with connection points, so no object oriented Codesys visu... (bad, very bad !!!     )- quite limited offer of HW typesTURCK:- V3 without safety- quite limited offer of HW typesBOSCH-REXROTH:- V3 = IndraLogic10EATON-MOELLER:- only Codesys V2, V3 not planned ! (they don't have reason to move to V3, their customers don't want it)WAGO:- only Codesys V2, V3 not planned ! (they don't have reason to move to V3, their customers don't want it)ABB:- only Codesys V2, V3 not planned ! (they don't have reason to move to V3, their customers don't want it)So the situation is not super/perfect in my opinion. I think industrial automation engineers need more info what is OOP and what profit it can bring.So my adventure "What hardware with Codesys V3" continues...    I'll appreciate any comment and/or info. Thanks...

If you look for a complete solution with support for everything, why not choose for an IPC (passive cooled, 24/7 harddisk, possibly with RAID system and UPS).This will support every fieldbus, CoDeSys (web-) Visualisation, Softmotion, Safety, etc.You will definately have enough memory and CPU power for every application.These are available all over the world.We sell IPC's of the company MSC-Tuttlingen (Dld.) in the Netherlands and this works perfect in combination with CoDeSys V3.

Hello TimvH,yes ! thats the obvious solution. But where can I buy codesys V3 license ? What company can deliver IPC with codesys licence including codesys support ?I'm not able to do it myself. I would buy Codesys Runtime OEM license (very very expensive) and develop my own implementation. Its definitely bad way (I'm not a hardware producer, I'm system integrator).

You can use any Windows (I)PC you want and install the CoDeSys SP WIN V3, or SP RTE V3.For this you can buy a single runtime license and don't need the OEM Toolkit.At the end of this year there will also be single licenses available for Linux systems (without OEM Toolkit).You should be able to buy this from your local distributor. We only sell these licenses in the Netherlands.

Ok. What local distributor can supply SP WIN V3, or SP RTE V3 ? Every distributor ? E.g. Wago, Turck, Schneider, Beckhoff, Bosch-Rexroth ? They supply own HW with Codesys implementation. Can they supply SP WIN V3, or SP RTE V3 too ?We don't have Codesys system partner in our country.Thanks TimvH for your help !!!

I should say that getting Codesys V3 license and HW is very problematic. I'd like to start use Codesys V3 and IPC hardware. However:- most of the worlwide available Codesys V3 PLC systems (Schneider SoMachine, WAGO, Rexroth, Turck, ...) are missing something (Safety, Visu, ...); I need all Codesys V3 features => IPC hardware;- Beckhoff new Twincat seems to be neverending story...(I suppose it'll be based on Codesys V3)- I have not get any answer for my emails from Codesys System Partners (3 companies in Germany). I've got answer from Netherlands company only. It recommended to contact 3S-Systems GmbH.- I have spent a lot of hours searching internet for suitable Codesys V3 IPC hardware with very poor results;I really wonder what should I do to solve my problem. Does 3S-Systems and its System Partners not want to do business ? Why System Partners in one EU country cannot sell licenses to other EU country ?  Yes, my words maybe sound a little bit angry, but after several months of searching Codesys V3 IPC hardware/license supplier I really start to feel desperate and disappointed... Is anybody able to help me ?

Hello,One company I come to think about is Janz - http://www.janztec.com/. The downloads they had looked like mainly CoDeSys 2.3 targets. But if you haven't been in touch with them it might be worth a shot.Best regards,Kristian Berlin

Another possible solution could be Asem (www.asem.it), Kontron, or Advantech....Please let me know which country you are from.As new CoDeSys System Partner in the Netherlands, we might be able to provide you the Single runtime licenses.See www.extendsmartcoding.nl, or www.codesys.nl.

kberlin: thanks for info.TimvH:great. I'm from Czech republic so buying Codesys license is not a problem from the formal point of view (payment, invoice etc...). Can you give me more information ? What Codesys RT version is available ? Target Visu / Web Visu / SoftMotion / Safety ? Additional tools ? Codesys Professional Developer Edition ? Etc...I think we can continue outside this forum. My email is "pnowak@handlix.cz".

I just sent you the price list for single licenses.This contains the prices for Control RTE/WIN/LINUX with options for SoftMotion (optionally CNC), Target- and/or Webvisualisation, and Safety (in combination with Beckhoff EL6900). It also included the option for version control (integration with subversion) and UML. This is part of the Professional Developer Edition.

could you also send me that price list for softmotion (codesys 2.3)

Please contact your local Distributor/System Partner firstIf there isn't any, please let us know which country you are from and which hardware you want to use.Without any e-mail address it is pretty difficult to send you the information
