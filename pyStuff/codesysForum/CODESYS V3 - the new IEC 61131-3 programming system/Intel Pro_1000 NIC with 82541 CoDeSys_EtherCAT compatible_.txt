The 3S "CoDeSys Control RTE Overview" leaflet states under the item Supported Fieldbusses/Fieldbus Cards that Intel Pro/1000 network cards based on the Intel 82551/82557 chips can be used for EtherCAT communication. My hardware supplier offers Intel Pro/1000 GT network cards, but they use the Intel 82541 control chip. See http://www.informatique.nl/550367/intel ... apter.html Is this NIC also allowed, or MUST it be one with the 82551 or 82557 controller?(The 3S "CoDeSys Control RTE V3" manual does not explicitely mention this)

Hi,even if it is not explecitely mentioned, the  Intel 82541  was tested and worked properly with EtherCAT on CoDeSys Control RTE.In any case: If you already have the card you can of course try - it should work.
