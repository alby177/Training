Hello Community,under projectsettings --> static analysis light, I enabled 'check for unused vars'. So If I declare an output var like this: Code:VAR_OUTPUT   itf_MyFB         : itf_FBExtended := THIS^;END_VARI allways get a Static analysis error: SA0033: unused var .... How to avoid this message? I know, that there is an attribute to exclude warnings, but for Static Analysis I've nothing found in the online Help.Thank you in advance.

With the installation of the Full Static Analysis functionality, you get a Add-On help topic in the online help.This describes the way how to deactivate specific rules.For unused variables, which is SA0033, you can use:Code:   {attribute 'analysis' := '-33'}    itf_MyFB         : itf_FBExtended := THIS^;   {attribute 'analysis' := '+33'}This way, if i is not used, this is ignored by static analysis.- is turning it off+ is turning it back on

 Wow - Now it's working. I think this needs definitly to be added to the standard pragma attribute list, because I didn't find it there. Cheers,Kevin
