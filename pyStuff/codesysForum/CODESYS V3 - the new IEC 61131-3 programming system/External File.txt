Can anyone please explain the purpose of external file in CoDeSys3.Can we use this file to pass parameters to the project for configration.

Hi,For examle you could download pdf files to the plc and show them in the visualisation or if it is a pc based controlShow them on your target.Sure maybe if you download inifiles you could read them for examle by inifile reader ..BREdwin

First issue is that I am not sure if the file is really downloaded onto the PLC as there is no indication2. Second issue is if it is downloaded what's the location/path of file?

Hi,which plc are you using (it depends on the runtime version too)You could check with the CODESYS file browser,the file will be downloaded runtime Directory /Plclogic/ApplicationBREdwin
