hello,I like to convert library from CodeSys 2.3 to CodeSys 3.x ?i think that is possible ! thanks.

Just open a codesys 2.3 project in codesys 3.5, then the converter starts.

Hello,When I'm opening a Codesys 2.3 library with Codesys 3.5, I do see some conversion taking place.Including the converted library into a 3.5 project does compile. But when trying to load it into a PLC, I get "Unresolved references"Any ideas where these come from?I also noticed in the converted library project, the POU tree shows (FB)(EXT) behind the POU name.In the 2.3 version of the project, (FB) is shown.What's the reason behind this (EXT)?Thanks in Advance

In the help files installed by the IDE can guide you through the steps. Converting a library can be tedeious and time prone.Also beware, there is no real guarantee that conversion will succeed, and there are several ways to do it!

Found the culprit of the "(EXT)".When saving the 2.3 project, I saved it as an "external" library. That meant I had to implement en compile the interface outside of Codesys, (for example in C).Saving the library as "internal" fixed it for me.Codesys 3.5 was able to convert it without any issues.
