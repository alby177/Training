Hi there.When I go to the download area, I can only download CODESYS V3.5 SP9 Patch 1 (current version).It looks as though this version is incompatible with Windows Server 2003 R2 (yes, I know it's end of life, but I'm stuck with it for now).Is there somewhere that I can download a previous version which is compatible?  All I am after is the Gateway.The reason that I am looking is that I wish to pull data out of an Elau PLC which runs CoDeSys v2.3.  I am hoping that by installing v3.5 I can run the Gateway as a service and automatically connect to the v2.3 Gateway when my server is rebooted.  At the moment, I have to maintain a login session whenever the server is rebooted because the Gateway will not run as a service, which is a pain.Many thanksRichard

Hello,I'm also looking for older versions of CodeSys RTE but on the link below you can only download the latest version:http://store.codesys.com/codesys-control-sm-rte-sl.htmlPrevious you could choose which version to download./Martin
