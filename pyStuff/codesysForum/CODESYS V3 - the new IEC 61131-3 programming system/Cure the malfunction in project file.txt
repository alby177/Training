Hi!I have several identical Modbus RTU devices. Once the first device was set up, the natural approach was  Copy-Paste the rest of instances. But problems came when I attempted to map the variables to I/O. I’ve got errors like:Attachment:Error.pngIt seems IDE automatically assigning duplicating addresses to I/O. Then building the project is being performed without errors, but downloading is not possible. Here the example:Attachment:Screen.PNGI screwed up my project twice before I met the Notice in help file:Please note that manually creating another instance of the device object can lead to malfunctions.I shortened the original project and attached it here for issue demonstration. I still not sure if Copy-Paste falls under “manual creating” device definition and would like to get clarification on this if possible please. But I will not dare to copy and paste the device and will use mapping export-import for now.The question would be if the spoiled project file could be cured somehow?
