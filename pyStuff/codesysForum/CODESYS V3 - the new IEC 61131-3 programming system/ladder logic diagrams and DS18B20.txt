Hi.I installed Codesys one week ago. From this it result that I'm very newer in this .I try to make a ladder logic diagrams project. In this project i want to read temperature from a DS18B20 sensor on a Raspberry device but without success.Can someone to help me in this? I put an screenshot for clarification.ThanksAttachment:ds18b20.jpg

Hi,see attched project, the instance of the onwire sensor is implicit generated by the System (name of the sensor in the device tree = instance name)you just need to access the Output DS18B20.rTempSee attached project - would recommend to access the onwire sensors in an own low prio task!BREdwin
