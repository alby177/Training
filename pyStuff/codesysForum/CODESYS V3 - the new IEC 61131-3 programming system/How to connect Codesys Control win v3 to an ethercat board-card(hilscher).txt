HI, there, I have Codesys V3.5.9 Patch10 and have created a project and selected a Codesys win V3 as the main device in the project(use my PC like a softPLC). I would like to connect a broadcard hilcher to control a staubli robot.  So i added a Ethercat master from one of the default option and i added a  .XML file as a slaves device. But i have a problem, when i run my project, an error appears in the PLC log, such as: Init slaves error: possibly slave missing or no communication at all.  in the same way. i have tried with my colleague's computer and i do not have the problem. so i think i have some problems with my Network settings.I would appreciate if someone could help me.Attachment:problem.pngAttachment:1.pngAttachment:2.pngAttachment:3.png
