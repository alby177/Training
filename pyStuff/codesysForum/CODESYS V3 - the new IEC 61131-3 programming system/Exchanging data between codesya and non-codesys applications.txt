Dear Sir,          We are trying to communicate with two applications in Power pc based target running QNX OS.One  is a IEC application running on codesys runtime.the other application  is written in C language and running external to Codesys  runtime.To exchange data between these two,we haev implemented shared memory concept. The shared memory is created on the Power PC target by the C program and  data is written on the shared memory . The codesys application reads  data  from the shared memory.Now we have to provide some method to lock/unlock the shared memory inorder to avoid simultaneous access  by C program and Codesys runtime application.The  Codesys runtime Manual (documentation)  memtions of a libray by name CmpBlkDrvShm which help us acheive this.It also mentions  a  symbol table by name "g_PlcObjTab" , which can be used to  provide synchronization.The library "CmpBlkDrvShm"  is unavailable on our  Codesys development System.How can we obtain  the  library ? Can you share some examples to use to use the library  functions. with regards,Mrs.Praveena
