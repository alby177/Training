This problem has gotten progressively worse. Even rebooting the system has not helped. What is the meaning of this error?Attachment:Capture.JPG

What is your target device? If it uses flash instead of HDD, then maybe your flash is used up and needs a flash cleanup (files deleted are typically marked for deletion and not actually deleted until flash cleanup).Or, the target may require user login... We need more info to help you

Running on a Lenovo PC with Windows 7 Pro. CoDeSys Control Win SL is the runtime module. HDD at 50 Gig used with 400 Gig available. 4 Gig DRAM installed.

Ok, so that rules out flash problems. Leaves either rights or a mistake in project. Can you post the project (strip out sensitive logic you don't want to share)? This is not an error I have seen before.  You could also try a dumb little basic project to see if you can download that.

It starts out loading the code but then after a while decides not to.This morning it is not loading after a boot up.

Tried two small projects and neither one loaded. Next I cleared all, recompiled and still no luck. Finally I did ONLINE:OPERATING MODE: DEBUG. Now all programs are loading even without recompiling.Thanks for your help.
