Hello, i have problem with Russian char in Dialog title in standart Numpad dialog....I set in Visualisation config using UTF, if i use some 'что то по русски' (ascii) then i have bed chars in title, if use "что то по русски" (utf) then again have bed chars. What i doing wrong?I use 3.5.6.0 version VisuDialogs.librraryI event try rewrite VisuDialogs.librrary and change string to wstring in dialog tiltle VAR in Numpad and in interface declaration. Then install new lib as version 3.5.6.1 and try to compile with it but have error can't convert string to wstring in new lib. But when i chek it before install it was ok, what it can be?Thank you.
