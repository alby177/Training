Hi, please could someone help me to find a solution to the following issue?I am using  ELAU PacDrive BackUP software, based on  3S Gateway Server 2.3.5.3, in order to make program bakups via Ethernet câble from ELAU C400 Controller. PacDrive BackUP is running on Windows XP 32 bits virtual machine on Vmware Workstation 12. I have set this VM bridged to NIC. Ping command in this VM works fine and can see my controller. PacDrive BackUP and 3S Gateway Server Inspector can see the IP of the ELAU C400 controller. But data transfert from the controller always  fails few minutes after the start, and I get the message: “Fatal communication error. The current process was interrupted. Please check the connection and restart the last procedure”, Gateway Server Inspector displays 89% for Ethernet packets quality.The same issue with Windows XP Mode. But, PacDrive BackUP on VM on Oracle Virtualbox works fine, and the program backup works with no problem.
