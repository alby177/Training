How to display Chinese charaters on a target? It will display messy code when switch the language "CN" defined in a text list.

I test under CoDeSys Control Win V3 on the same PC and get messy code。

In Online mode，I got correct result in CoDeSys IDE，but wrong in the target Win V3.

When you double click on the "Visualisation Manager" you see as first option "Use Unicode Strings". You need to enable this option.After this it should work correctly (I tested it with 3.5.1.3).- Make sure you download your application after changing this, it doesn't work with an online change.- For Unicode string functions (WSTRING), make sure you add the Standard64 library.

Yes，it works！Thanks
