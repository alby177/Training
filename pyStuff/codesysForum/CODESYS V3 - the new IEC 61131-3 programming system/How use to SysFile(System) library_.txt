Hi, I want to create a new file and write a INT value to this file, then close it. Unfortunately I am not so familiar with the file system. How do I must do?Thanks!B/RRita

I would recommend using the OsCat Network Library it has been tested and validated. It also has a built in File Handler with FB's to read/write variables from files.You have to be signed in to download. This has been updated for CoDeSys V3.http://www.oscat.de/community/index.php ... 784.0.html

To read or write a file ,you must be carefull of something.The functions all needed a rising-edge to excute.Also, at the end of the programs ,you should close the file.I suggest you to use CIA FILE LIB.

Hi,Can you please provide me a working sample code for Write and Read File using Codesys v3 ?Thanks,Naganatha Subramanian R
