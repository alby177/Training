Hallo  Can anyone help me with a sample code for J1939 using the IoDrvJ1939 (FBs) not over PLC configuration, because the documentation for the function blocks is not quite clear.Thanks in advance.

Hi,this is impossible to use without using the configuration and add it to the device tree.BREdwin

In other words, I need a program for J1939 using (DM1_Read, DM2_Read, DM1_Write, DTC Provider .....etc.).Thanks

Tell me if this is what you're looking to do.
