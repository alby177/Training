Hello everybody,I am working with a CoDeSys v3.4 and when I try to open "Help" menu, the CoDeSys get collapsed and closed.Could anybody help me?Thanks in advance!

Hi,it seems that there is something wrong with the installation. I would propose to de-install CoDeSys (perhaps save your projects in case you have saved them in one of the installation directories), make a new download and re-install it again.This is definitely no general problem.

Thank you very much but I have tried what you purposed and I still have the same problem.

Really strange!   I have no explanation for that effect. If it is not the setup you have installed that the only thing I could imagine is a problem on your PC. Do you have another PC available where you can test it?

Sorry for the delay answering but in other PCs I have not had this issue.I still have this problem on that PC. I also suppose that there should be something inside the PC

In any case you could try the latest release CoDeSys V3.4 SP4. If the effect has not disappeared then it is really most likely a problem of that special PC.
