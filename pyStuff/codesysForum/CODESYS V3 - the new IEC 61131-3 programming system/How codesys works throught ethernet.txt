Hello everyone,I want to know how codesys v3 work throught ethernet, I've readed the manual and I've achieved some conclusions but it would be very helpfull to have your opinion.In the manual says that Codesys v3 can work in two methods:UDP, ports from 1740 to 1743TCP, ports from 11740 to 11743But, the automatic search of the device works only via UDP, am I wrong?In the other side, PLC's that works with Codesys I've found that not all can work in both methods, for example, IFM CR1083 can work both UDP or TCP, but some TTControl that I've test only works in UDP, not TCP.So all the PLC's that works with codesys works with UDP 1740-1743?Is the TCP 11740-11743 connection something that is optional and only some of them implement it?So those are my questions, thanks for your help
