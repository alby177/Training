Hello, we are adding extra topics to the Codesys HTML Help, and I am working from the instructions in the PDF "OEM Documentation: Extending the CODESYS Online Help"This explains how to use XML .merge files to control where additional CHM files are positioned in the Help's Table of Contents.I can get it all to work except for the Code:<InsertPosition> element... I've tried various permutations of this, and followed examples in the PDF, but it does not seem to have any effect. I am not sure what I am doing wrong! Can anyone else confirm that they've successfully used this element?
