Hello, I want to make a 10x2 array but in each column I want to have different type of data .In the first column string type in the second bytes, is it possible to make something like that?Any ideas?Thanks

Create an array of structures.First define the structure (type DUT) with a string and a byte.Then declare a variable as an array of this structure.

Thanks for your reply, can you explain it a little more please...

First create the structure:Attachment:ScreenShot1.jpgAttachment:ScreenShot2.jpgThen create an array of this structure:Attachment:ScreenShot3.jpgYou can get access to the items in the array in e.g. structured text as:Code:astMyStruct[0].byByte := 10;astMyStruct[0].sString := 'Hello';

Thank you I aprreciate it so much..it's a big help for me
