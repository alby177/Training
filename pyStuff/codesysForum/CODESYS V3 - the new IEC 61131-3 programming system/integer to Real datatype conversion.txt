I am trying to convert a data in integer datatype to Real datatype. I have tried many ways but not able to accomplish the task. Please suggest the correct methodThanks Joel

I think you're looking for Operator ‘TO_<xxx>.

Which 'To xxxx' operator is the correct one? I have already tried with To Real, To ASCII.

TO_REAL should work for you.  ASCII is not a valid data type but STRING is.  This works for me...Code:VAR   MyInt   : INT:=42;   MyReal   : REAL;END_VARMyReal := TO_REAL(MyInt);
