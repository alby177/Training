With Tools / Device Repository, you can import a CANopen eds file. And next this CANopen slave is available in the editor, ready to use.When importing a CANopen eds file, the result is placed in the folder: Code:C:\ProgramData\CODESYS\Devices\18\*\device.xmlAnd at the top the comment is read:  Code:<!--created with CoDeSys 3.0 (http://www.3s-software.com) by DeviceDescriptionBuilder (3S-Smart Software Solutions GmbH)-->Is the DeviceDescriptionBuilder a separate application?And can I use it, to import CANopen eds files, via the command line. Without the GUI?. The reason, for the command line, is that I (will) have very much variations on a template CANopen eds file.And I want to automate the CANopen eds file / CoDeSys handling.When I can use a command line version, the whole build process is / will be automated. Which is time saving and reduces errors.So is a command line application available, such as "Device Description Builder"?Regards,Edwin.

Hi Edwin,you could use the RepTool, you'll find this here:"c:\Program Files (x86)\3S CODESYS\CODESYS\Common\RepTool.exe" Usage: RepTool --profile=[profile] [action]where [action] is one of:[…]   --installDevice <deviceName> [<deviceName_2>...<deviceName_n>]                    Install the specified devdesc files   --importDevice --converter=<guid> [--parameters="key1=vallue1;...keyn=valluen;"] <deviceName> [<deviceName_2>...<deviceName_n>]                    Import the specified device description files using the specified converter                    Currently supported:                    EthernetIP  {a9889815-3b0a-4024-9177-73e55bbd6fd7}                    GSD         {bc118cc4-7273-4ba0-ad4c-07eb2b94f315}                    Sercos3     {cdde0374-9efd-401e-93c8-f19443fb60ed}                    Native      {d0f8e825-cb17-4699-ac62-b6878fc5b404}                    EDS         {1ce4a9c1-37d3-496c-9e80-cd99ad3807ee}                    Ethercat    {3992c588-7bdb-4a7c-908d-f444808d8cd2}                    GSDML       {6066aef4-f19a-41ac-a249-721bdae32d40}   --installDevicesRecurs <folderpath>                    Install all devdesc files in a folder to the system repository.[…]Best RegardsEdwin S.

Thank you.I used the tool in the build scripts and it is working very well.
