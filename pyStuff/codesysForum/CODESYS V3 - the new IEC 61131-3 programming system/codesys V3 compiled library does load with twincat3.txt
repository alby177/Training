Dear members, I have written a library of function blocks which references the standard library 3.5.7.0. I used some TON/TP blocs in my library. I succcessfully create a compiled library that I can use in a projet set up with codesys programming system.Now I would like to give this compiled library to a customer using Twincat3. He cannot install it with library manager.He has got a message "GenerateFlow,GenerateBP,GenerateBP2 is not a valid value for StatementFlag"Does anyone have an idea why my compiled library cannot be installed in Twincat 3 ? Any information would be appreciated.Kurvanov

I further investigated this issue and it seems that the problem comes from Codesys Compiler version 3.5.7.0I tried to generated a compiled version of my library with compiler version 3.5.6.60.  Codesys Development system automaticaly includes Standard library 3.5.5.0. Twincat 3 is now able to install my library into library repository and I can add my library to my twincat 3 project.Seems to be a bug isn't it ?Any comments are appreciatedKurvanov
