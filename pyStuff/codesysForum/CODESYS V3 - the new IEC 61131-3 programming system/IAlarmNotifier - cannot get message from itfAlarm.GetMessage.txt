I have a function block that implements the IAlarmNotifier interface, I have it doing most of what I want, but I cannot get the alarm message. The key part of the execute method is below. Any ideas why GetMessage always returns a null string. I am successfully getting the name of the AlarmGroup and the AlarmClass it is just this interface function that is tripping me up.{attribute '''DOCU__COMMENT' := ' Executes the action.'}(* Executes the action.*)METHOD ExecuteVAR_INPUT	(* The currently processed alarm state transition. This will be evaluated in order to determine, whether the action has to be executed or not*)	eCurrTransition	: AlarmStateTransition;	(* The alarm, for which the action has to be performed*)	itfAlarm	: IAlarm;	(* An optional pointer to a structure variable containing additional parameter*)	pbyAdditionalData	: POINTER TO BYTE;END_VARVAR	cbpMessage: AlarmManager.CharBufferPtr;   (* for holding the AlarmMessage *)END_VAR-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------cbpMessage := itfAlarm.GetMessage(__SYSTEM.TYPE_CLASS.TYPE_STRING);StrConcatA(cbpMessage,ADR(sLastAlarm[0]),USINT_TO_INT(SIZEOF(sLastAlarm)));

Hi David,The message text is empty because no visualization occurs in the project.background:Without visualization, the text lists are not transferred to the control, and therefore the text can not be determined.This is as designed, to fix that you Need to add a visu to your project.Edwin

Thanks Edwin - that worked a treat. I would never have guessed that
