Hi.I have a simple Ladder program that has this:- "Low Flow Switch" forwarded by a "Pump on" status.- If both are true, after some time, it sets a "Low Flow alarm".- "Low Flow alarm" turns off the pump.- Now, as the pump is off, "Low Flow alarm" is also false.The problem is: "Low Flow alarm" is only true for a single scan, and it is not showing on the Alarm Table on the WebVisu. If I remove the "Pump on" status from the logic, for testing purposes, it works. Is there a minimum time the variable needs to remain true so AlarmGroup triggers its alarm?

Never tested this myself, but what you might check:- in the Task Configuration is a implicit call to the AlarmManager.Alarm_Prg.- the scan-time is 50ms (default for the Control Win)- Probably your program is called from the MainTask which is called every 20ms- If this is true, than you program has already set the alarm variable to false before the Alarm_Prg has seen is.Maybe by playing with these settings a little you can optimize it, but as mentioned, I am not sure so please let us know your results.Another solution could also be to extend the time this alarm bit is true with e.g. a TOF timer.

Thanks.
