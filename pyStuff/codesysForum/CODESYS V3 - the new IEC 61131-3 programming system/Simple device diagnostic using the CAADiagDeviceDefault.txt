Hello,can anyone share a simple example program (or some pointers) for doing very basic device (as in bus slave device)  diagnostic using the generic CAADiagDeviceDefault objects that are defined for each master and slave device once you enable "Enable Diagnosis for devices" ? I guess it doesn't really matter what bus it actually is (Modbus, ProfiBus, CANOpen...) since this interface is implemented for all of them.All I would need is something to start with...just the status if the device is present or not.I'm looking at the documentation in the caa_devicediagnosis library, but I'm not really sure how to get a working GetDeviceState() method call for each device.Thanks in advance for any help or tips.
