Hello!Please help with one thing - is there any way to get extended info about master and slave states or diagnose comm.link errors?I've read OnlineHelp (core_EtherCAT_Configuration_Editor.chm) and this Forum FAQ. Having the following hardware - PLC (QNX+Codesys Runtime) and IO-modules of own design - i'm testing the whole system.So I can detect the moment when EtherCAT is configured OK (xConfigFinished), restart the master (xRestart) or stop it (xStopBus), enumerate slave modulesi can get the current state of the slave (wState) or may try to switch it to OP modeBut how can i get some more statistics about frames (sent/errors) and read register's data and port's states from slaves? like f.e twincat offers it:What is the difference between demo and licensed EtherCAT master? Sources? Technical support?Would "CAA Device Diagnosis" lib help me with it?BR, Eugene

Hi Eugene,thanks for reproting this, I have added an improvement in our Improvement/tracking database.Quote:What is the difference between demo and licensed EtherCAT master? Sources? Technical support?Would "CAA Device Diagnosis" lib help me with it?a) EthercatMaster in demo runs unlicensed for 30minb) which sources do you need - reading SDO example is available in Ethercat Store maybe we need to extend this example for the diagnosis functions - would be helpfulb) CAA Device Diagnosis is generic fieldbus Independent for all the same interfaceBREdwin
