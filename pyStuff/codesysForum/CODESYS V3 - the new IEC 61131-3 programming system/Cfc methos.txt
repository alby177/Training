Dears.It is possible to call a fb.method feom an cfc editor?

Yes.  Calling it can be a bit tricky.If the method is from the POU, then you can just call the method by putting the method name inside the box without an instance label on top (see "Increment" in my screenshot).If the method is from a FB instance, you label inside the box with the FB.method and on top of the box your instance (see "Decrement" in my screenshot).My CoDeSys version underneath my OEM software: 3.5.6.66Attachment:screenshot.png

Thanks a lot Scott.I have test the first solution and it has not work. I suppose it is  a version problem.But the question is: how you have disvovered the second solution.

Scott.I have test it but I have problems with inherited methods:To use inherited methods with the first method it is necessary to overload the method in the inherited class and call the method using this^. After that it is possible to erase the inherited method and the this^. In this case the method doesn't works if it has not outputs, and is not possible to update pins.The better solution is using the second option that Scott has said:Attachment:Captura de 2017-03-03 15-52-43.pngThanks
