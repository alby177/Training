who can supply some projects for me to help me improve programming on COSESYS about SoftMotion.

In the folder where you have installed CODESYS is a subfolder with several good (training) examples.See C:\ (... Program Files\3S CoDeSys ...) \CoDeSys\Projects\SoftMotion\Examples\Tutorial

I know. But they are not enough. I want to get a complete softmotion project, which has some background of application.Expectedly, you can help me.

I have to dissapiont you, If you want a complete machine solution, you have to do it by your self. That means that you have to learn by books, tutorials, datasheets you could even go to some time on codesys training. We all have to go trough that process and It didn't happend trough night.regardsAlex

But the reference on codesys is few, And It's difficult to get a useful book. Can you recommend some books to read?
