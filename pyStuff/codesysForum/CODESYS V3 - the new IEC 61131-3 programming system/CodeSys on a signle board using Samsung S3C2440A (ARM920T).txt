Hi everybody,               I'm new to CoDeSys and to PLC in general, so please be patient with me !   I'm looking for a board powerful enough to manage a couple of projects I have to develop for my clients (I'm a consultant).Until now I have developed custom electronic boards for my projects, but now I got some request for "normal" applications and the development of new boards is both too expensive and too slow.Looking around I found this board: http://www.shop.kristech.eu/download/EM2440-III-OV.pdf It isn't indicated as supporting CoDeSys, but it can use both Linux and Windows CE. The processor is the Samsung S3C2440A, who's core is an ARM920T.Since in the CoDeSys site documentation I found that it can work with most ARM cores and in both Linx and Windows, I wonder if it is possible to use CoDeSys to program this board and, eventually, what still misses to make it possible.Thank very much for any answer                                            JPV

What you need to do is implement the runtime on this board.See: http://www.3s-software.com/index.shtml?en_businessmodel

So,  I understood that the run time system has to be adapted to any given hardware with theRun Time Toolkit. If I got it, the Run Time Toolkit would be needed totell what function every pin has, either general I/O or specific ... Is it right ?

With the development tool CoDeSys you create your application.When this application is compiled and downloaded to the device it is executed by the runtime.You are correct that this runtime needs to be implemented on, and adapted to, the specific hardware (CPU/OS combination + memory).You also need to access the I/O. This could be done by using a standard driver (CAN / EtherCAT / Modbus / etc.), but as OEM you also have the possibility to create your own I/O drivers.When you buy the runtime toolkit, you will implement and adapt the runtime on your hardware together with 3S-Smart Software Solutions. You wil also be explained how to create your own drivers and external Function Blocks.You can create the drivers in IEC code or C(++). This gives you great flexiblility.An alternative is to use a standard platform with Windows XP/7 (embedded). Then you can just buy the Control RTE or Control Win.At the end of the year there will also be a standard Linux distribution for which you can buy Single Licenses.
