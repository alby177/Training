Hello,I got this error after upgrading the controller and codesys from SP4 to SP5. There is no data stored in the .sqlite files, however they are created.I have added a bunch of trend recordings to the Project, after that I got this database error. I have tried to replicate the error by starting a new Project and just adding alarm manager with alarmstorage and trend recording but that Project works as intended. I have changed the compiler to the new version and update the device. I have tried to delete Alarm manager and TrendRecording and adding those again, still no luck. Any ideas?

Hi,you could change the default setting (-> allocating 2MB)by the following setting in the CODESYSControl.cfg[CmpCAAStorage]Memsys5SizeInMB=xso you could add 3 as x here to have 3MB Memory allocated for CAA Storage.BREdwin

Hi Edwin;Thnx for help. I add to *.config your text and its work.Now 28 trends is recording.Thank you so muchBRRecep
