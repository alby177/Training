Hi,there is no driver available for the iXXAT Interface.'Component.5=CmpPCANBasicDrv' is for Peak-Systems CANUSB Interface & Control Win.BREdwin

Thank you Edwin or a quick response.Is there likely to be a driver for the IXXAT card,or should i look for a CANUSB interface device to get this setup working.David
