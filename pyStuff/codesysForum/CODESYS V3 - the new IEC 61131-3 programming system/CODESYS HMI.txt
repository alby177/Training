Is it possible to use two (WinCE based) panels, in the following configuration:- One running PLC and visualiyation- The second panel is just a Visualization client using data from the 1st PLCIs there a way to purchase separate license for the 2nd panel HMI client?(I know, it works fine with webvisu, but we'd like to use panels from the same brand at both places, and web browser on these panels is not very sophisticated.... (WinCE5))

Hello Strucc,there is a product called 'remotetargetvisu',probably exactly what you are looking for.You could check this on you CODESYS Windows Installation : execute "c:\Program Files (x86)\3S CODESYS\GatewayPLC\RemoteTargetVisu.exe" then you get on first start the configuration file to edit.Please add the IP address of your plc (your CE device) nothing else.Then execute it again, then you will have a fullscreen HMI on Windows. (Nothing needed to add in the CODESYS project)Now step two:You need to ask your plc manufacturer if they have the 'remotetargetvisu' for their Windwos CE device available.BREdwin

Dear Edwin,Unfortunately EATON doesn't license remotetargetvisu. Instead, they recommended:- Use of data server (sometimes tricky with our application, as it's using interfaces in VISU)- Use CeRemoteClient - this makes an exact copy of the screenWe ended up with the second "workaround".Is there any way to license remotetargetvisu for WinCE directly from 3S?
