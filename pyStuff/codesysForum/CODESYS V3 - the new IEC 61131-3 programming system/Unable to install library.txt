Hello, i try to install CAA_Memory library but i cannot find it. It is appear only if i check simulation mode.How i can install this library in normal mode.

Hi,navigate to "Tools --> Options --> Features" and uncheck "Enable simplified library handling" and probably also "Hide system libraries".This should solve your problem.
