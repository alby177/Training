hi Everyonei have a fast Task which does the data read write function and a slow Task which uses it. How should the data structure be transfered to the slow Task. Any experince with the SysSem lib, could someone make a small example.Thanks

Is there a reason you don't want to use global variables for this?  I guess I'm assuming the tasks are in the same controller...

The Output from the Fast Task is a structure of Structures. I was thinking of maybe using a function block rather than global variable to get the data to the Slow Task. I am not sure which way would be efficent.

I like the simplest solutions.I would try doing it with the global variable method.
