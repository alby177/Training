Hello,I am using Codesys V3.5 SP9 Patch 1 + to program a CODESYS Control arm Macq P6/ARM/Linux Version 3.5.9.10without the Redundancy Configuration the program compiles correctly. When adding the Redundancy Configuration there are a lot of C0035 and C0046 errors for instances of FB's.When deactivating the check boxes for the global variable lists containing these function blocks the program compiles correctly.Example : in Global variable list GVL_SIA there are 3 instances of function blocks with each a method used to pass a command to an other function block:- Command                   Method : switch_relay- switching_table           Method : set_switching_table- livebit                         Method : is_onlineAttachment:GVL_SIA_AND_FB_CC_COMMAND.pngwhen this global variable list (or anny other global list containing FB's) is checked in the tab Registered Areas of the Redundancy manager there are two errors at compile for each function block:Attachment:errors.png
