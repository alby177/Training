My co-worker and i keep coming across this issue in SoMachine 4.1 SP2.We have 1 controller file for the customer's PLC. Sometimes after we (either of us) login to the PLC, specifically when viewing structured text we get the aforementioned "Object reference is not set to an instance of an object" error. If we try to access local variables in the watch window we get the object reference error. We can't view any local variables in the variable declaration area of the POU. And EVEN WORSE The structured text appears as if it we aren't logged in at all THEREFORE we cannot see any of the variable values in the structured text window.  The only view we can see "live data" in, is ladder logic. This makes it extremely difficult to support our customers and we have no clue what could be causing this. Obviously, we could perform a fresh download but that will not allow us to troubleshoot the customer's issue.HEEEELLLLPPPP!!!  

Hi.Could be that your action doesn t run?The actiin is called from anywhere assigned to a task?
