Hello,We would like to use the internal visu for commissioning only.This is why we do not want to not invest to much manpower into the project specific visualisation creation.Our interest would be to create for each technological object a visu along to each FB.Inside the visu we would like to insert this visu as a Frame into the visualisation.What we now would like is to assign on the fly (while the PLC is running) the FB associated to this Frame.I didn't see yet in the online help if this is possible. Can anybody give me a hint pleaseFaulenzer

See http://store.codesys.com/visualization-switching.html

I have now looked into the example.This approach isn't 100% what I had in mind.Instead of switching the content of a frame (as in the examples), my interest is to work always with the same frame content.This frame content has one single structured INOUT variable, and somehow I would like to modify on the fly to the variable instance it is associated with.In case it is only for viewing, I could use as a workaround a SELECT function which copies instance n of all my objects (of the same type) into the visu relevant variable.This doesn't work anymore if a writing operation is necessary.While writing this lines, I have an idea. Maybe I can pass as INOUT variable a pointer and dereference it for the painting properties..But if anybody else has a splendid idea I am glad to listen.
