Hi.It seems you have library errors. Go first to library manager and check download mising libraries.It is possible that after, some errors persist. Go to properties and watch wich librariea has not placeholder click on it and select the library the system proposes.I d recomend to you to work with codesys english version, helps are better, amd if you need some help is better to show an english screen.
