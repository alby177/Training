Hi all,Can anyone tell me how to configure a Wago 750-632 module for 2 valve operation?The manual (http://www.wago.mx/download.esm?file=%5 ... xx_0en.pdf) says that I need 12 bytes to achieve that but my valve configuration shows only 6.I'm using the Wago 750-632 and several other cards on a PFC200.Thanks in advance.

Hi,could you please ask this question in the CODESYS store,'my question' an adapted device description is needed.BREdwin

Use Wago I/O Check to configure wether its 1 or 2 coils among other things.

Hi,and you need an slightly changed/extended device description...BREdwin

Thanks for the replies.@EdwinI've asked this in the CODESYS store and they sent me a editted XML file.somlioy wrote:Use Wago I/O Check to configure wether its 1 or 2 coils among other things.I think these cards are configured for two valves out of the box. (I checked this with I/O Check)
