Hi folks,I am looking to use a WORD data type to store a unicode character - I have chosen the WORD datatype as this is the underlying data type of the WSTRING.Basically I would like to be able to say:Code:VAR    wTemp: WORD;END_VARwTemp := "<";and to have the hex value of < put into the variable.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------I have found a way around this problem but it is very un-eloquent and goes like this:Code:VAR    wsTempString: WSTRING := "<";    wTempWord: WORD;END_VARwTempWord := wsTempString[0];This has the desired effect of placing the hex value of < into wTempWord, but the readability of the program is awful, is there a way I can write the unicode character straight into the WORD variable.I'm thinking of C in doing this: Code:temp = 'A';Any help appreciated./Pete

I don't know if a function for this already exists, but it is pretty easy to make:Code:FUNCTION WS_TO_W : WORDVAR_INPUT   WS   : WSTRING(1);END_VARVAR   pW : POINTER TO WORD;END_VARCode:pW := ADR(WS);WS_TO_W := pW^;Then call this from your applicationCode:wWord := WS_TO_W("<");
