HelloI'd like to use the Oscat Basic library. The latest is 3.3.3My target has a runtime of 3.5.10.10, and uses the Standard library 3.5.9.0The Oscat library references 3.3.0.10 of the Standard Library. Is this a problem? I'm sure that I've read that there can only be one version.Please see the screen shot for a clear explanation.Thanks

I have solved the problem oppening osct library, changing standard librry and recompiling.But I it is possible that the problem could be solved in easiest form

Hi,I would uninstall your 3.31 Version OSCAT lib from your library repository and install the Version from CODESYS store.In this Version this is correct.BREdwin
