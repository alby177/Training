Hi I am new to CoDeSys 3.3

Where do I find any docs on for example SysSocket.lib. The built in document only gives a list of in and out and their types. Nothing on what to use or even examples of using each function.

What do I do ?

best regards

Thanks for the reply shooter

So you have the same problem.

How does anyone ever use CoDeSys anyway if there is no documentation?

Also the S3 people can not even give simple answers on their own forum

Not impressed so far

the overall use of codesys is very easy, but the blocks used are without any example and i think a lot of software is reinvented on many places.

i would like to have a forum with bits of software on codesys.
something like oscat has now.
