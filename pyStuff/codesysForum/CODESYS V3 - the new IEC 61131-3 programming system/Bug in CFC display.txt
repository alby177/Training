If you have a function block A which extends another function block B and if B has 2 var_input variables. A has 3 VAR_INPUT CONSTANT variables. When we put a box of type A on the CFC chart we see that the inputs shown are not the ones defined in B but 2 of the constant inputs defined in A. These are then also repeated in the parameters button of this block.I think this is not how it should behave

I have included a project to illustrate the point. If you pull in a Box of type POU1 in the program in the project. The bug is visible.
