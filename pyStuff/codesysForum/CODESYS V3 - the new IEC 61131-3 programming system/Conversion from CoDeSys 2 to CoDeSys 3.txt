Hello guys,there is the possibilty to "convert" automatically a project from CoDeSys2 to CoDeSys3?If yes, how to do that?...I suppose that it is impossible... but the hope is last to die!   Thank you for your answer

Hi! I know that Festo have a converting tool in there pakage, but I have not used it or even started it.I also think that this is something that 3S have made.You can download Codesys V3 ISO from Festo./Torbj√∂rn

Does it works also in demo mode?Or Festo's CoDeSys is free?

Festo is free like 3S.

It is very easy. You can open the V2.3 project in V3. V3 then automatically converts it.Choose, "file open" and select the V2.3 project (project before 3.0).

Is there anything special with the libraries? I can open some projects, but some of them are not working. It reminds me that i have to convert libraries/open existing one...

Yes, off course there will be changes necessary.You will need to understand how your application is setup and which libraries need to be added/changed.Besides this you will probably need to configure your I/O again.

Thank you at all for your reply!
