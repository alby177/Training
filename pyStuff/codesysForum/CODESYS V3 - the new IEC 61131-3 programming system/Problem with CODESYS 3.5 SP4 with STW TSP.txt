Hi,For the last few weeks, I have been having a very unusual issue with CODESYS 3.5 SP4. I get the installation supplied by STW, which comes with CODESYS 3.5 SP4 and a target support package for STW. STW haven't been any help with this issue so wondering if someone here can help.Basically, the software suddenly began to get 'corrupted' somehow, I'm fairly sure by a windows update or something. What happens is I am no longer able to click on and edit 'devices', and resultedly am unable to log into and debug our controller (STW ESX-3XL). It's like devices become completely unavailable. I've attached screenshots that show the problem.Is there anyone else here using STW CODESYS that has experienced a similar issue? Or someone using normal CODESYS maybe? Having a hard time working through this, and our IT guys are kind of stumped trying to work it out. I will say that at this stage we think it's an issue with the Windows .NET Framework, as we see a .NET Runtime Error on the Event Viewer coincide with every time the software get's damaged.Any help here from someone would be greatly appreciated.Cheers,Andrew.

Basically, I have lost the Device Editor. Does anyone know how I could get it back? Anyone that understands a bit more about how the CODESYS software interacts with the Device Editor function?Best regards,Andrew.

If anyone is interested, we discovered that our Antivirus software was removing the Device Editor Plug-In DLL file from the CODESYS Program Files. (Program Files -> 3S CODESYS V3.5 -> CODESYS -> PlugIns).No idea why it would but that seems to have been the problem.Regards,Andrew
