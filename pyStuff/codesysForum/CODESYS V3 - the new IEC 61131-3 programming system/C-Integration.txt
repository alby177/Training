I am an independent developer and have been asked to implement a function block library that interfaces to a robot through API calls to a c library.  I found a very old Raspberry thread about a c-integration feature being added in SP7 but the implications were not clear.  Can someone confirm that interfacing to a c library is only possible for OEM partners or if the is now otherwise available?  If it's not possible then I can pursue a network based solution but I would like to know my options before taking a decision.  Thanks in advance for your input.

I thought I saw it available in the CoDeSys store, but it's not there - maybe they took it off?  They only offer it now to manufacturers of machine controllers (https://www.codesys.com/products/codesys-engineering/c-integration.html).  You are right about >=SP7.  Looks like you are going down the "plan B" route.

Thanks Scott but it would be nice to know or certain.  It's disappointing that someone from 3S hasn't simply replied YES or NO.
