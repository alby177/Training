I'm doing a simple exercise for learning purpose about SFC and ST on CodeSys, in which there is a dip switch object in the visualisation.The dip switch change the boolean value of a variable called sig1.The application is running in a step that execute this code when it's active:sig1 := TRUE;(I'm aware that it's better to put this code in the entry action of the step, but it is only a basic test that I'm doing)and the exit transaction is:"NOT sig1"If I change sig1 from TRUE to FALSE by the dip switch, it doesn't assert the exit transaction because the code "sig1 := TRUE;" will change another time the sig1 variable.I think that this is due to the fact that the dip switch will always be slower than the assigment in the step action, but It could be that a changement via the visualization is not made immediately but only before the next iteration of the step action. Could someone explain to me this behaviour?In particular, if a variable's value changement made by a visualisation object is done immediately or not.Thank you.
