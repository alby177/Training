Still every time i scan the network and try to go online it ask for user and password. 2. Reset origin. I can't do that be curse when i go online it still every time i scan the network and try to go online it ask for user and password.  3. Tried to flash it back to an old wago image. it won't flash back, and i also want the Codesys 3.5.12.0 image on the controller.So i'm really lost. I don't care about the program on the controller i just need to reset everything.i have the root password to the web management, but this don't help me out, and i can also telnet and ftp.Just not download a new project to the controller.I Really hope someone can help me out ASAP, i spend a lot of time try and fail    Jesper

Hi Jesper,How to bring the PFC back to original Wago delivery state:Write the firmware from Wago to an SD card boot from it,and copy the SD to the Flash,  (WBM) After doing this, nothing remains from CODESYS V3 on the PFC.BREdwin
