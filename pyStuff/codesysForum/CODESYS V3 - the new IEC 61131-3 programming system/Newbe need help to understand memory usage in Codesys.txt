Hi guys, I'm new to this tool Codesys and is trying to create a plc system as the client and a pc as the server/controller of the PLC.We have inherited an old 800M PLC system and I like to update and convert it into cheaper systems like AC500.Today, the system sends a ascii message to the plc and there it is parsed out using case .. of.Now to my problem, I have multiple physical I/O's to controls ie valv/rods to handle and from the case I call to the valv/rod nr to execute.I've created a function block using CFC. and a input-variable to call. Global variables for global usageThe message (Telegram) is read, if any exists every 500ms,The total executiontime for functionValv() is 70 sec.After 60 sec I want to place another call to  prepare execution of other programs/functions first call  |----------------------------------------------------||-----other exec----| sec call                                                            |---------------------------------------------------||---In my CASE steg OF1:   functionValve( en:=Enabled, parameterArray:= parameters);2:      functionValve( en:=Enabled, parameterArray:= parameters);...ORfunctionValv1:functionValv();CASE steg OF1:   functionValve1( en:=Enabled, parameterArray:= parameters);2:      functionValve2( en:=Enabled, parameterArray:= parameters);...ORfuncArray[1] := functionValv1;  funcArray [2] functionValv2;CASE steg OF1:  funcArray[steg](en:=Enabled, parameterArray:= parameters);2: funcArray[steg](en:=Enabled, parameterArray:= parameters);....Now my question is, What would be the working and best way to create the calls?/anders

Hi to myself I've managed to resolve my problem, as to understanding that: I can have one implementation of my function block and make multiple instances and assign into an array and use "CASE indexNr OF" loop to index out the specific instance to run and assign parameter values when callingI've also understood that I have to make input assignment to make a controlled usage, ie I'm creating my own datatype, make variables and configure them on startup and modify during runtime and use as input on function calls.What I don't understand sofar is how the memory usage is for my instances above. Will I run out of memory a.s.o.Time will tell /a

If the platform is PC based you are swimming in a vast sea of bytes and will take quite some time before you reach any shore.
