Hello,I am looking for a way to change an image live on the file system and have it updated on the target/web visu.It seems that once the runtime has loaded, it will always display a cached version of the image on the targetvisu.I have tried unregistering/registering the file, but it does not seems to do anything.Code:BmpPoolUnRegister(IMAGE_POOL_ID);BmpPoolRegister(szFile := IMAGE_FILE_LOCATION, szId := IMAGE_POOL_ID);I have also tried registering a new file under a new ID without any luck.Changing the page does not help either.Is there a way to do this without restarting the runtime in 3.5.4.x?Thanks!

Hi,this is only possible with a setting:in webvisu.cfg.json in /visu   "NumCachedImages": 0 Code:{        "UpdateRate": 200,        "PlcAddress": "0000.9ED4.C1D5",        "UseLocalHost": true,        "Application": "Application",        "StartVisu": "SendTweetVisu",        "NumCachedImages": 0,        "BestFit": true,        "LogLevel": "INFO",        "CommBufferSize": 50000,    "HasKeyboard": false}Then you need to take care that CODESYS doen not overwrite webvisu.cfg.json on every download  - make it readonly or change the name in CODESYS to  webvisu_my in CODESYS.BREdwin
