Hello guys,I'm using codesys to work on a project now. I want to export CSV file of the history data. So I can analyse it with matlab. I searched many things and find the program in the attachments. I have made some test, but no file exported. Does anyone have any idea what the problem is? Or maybe kindly teach me how can I get the CSV data file. Thank you!

look at this sample program...it writes 100 real values multiplied by 3600 rows (360000 values) in a csv file.maybe it gives you an inspiration ?I used he Codesys V3.5SP9Patch5 and the Codesys ControlWINV3 as runtime...Attachment:csv.JPGAttachment:test_csv.projectwollvieh.

After writing to the file you need to wait until the write operation is actually performed before closing the file.  The SysFile lib you are using should tell how to examine error, status, etc

Hello wollvieh,Thanks for your help. I  have seen your program in another post. But maybe because the different patch, I can not run your program. I have no idea what is the problem. Seems like the program I found is right, but no file exported. I will try find out what is going on. Thanks again.wollvieh wrote:look at this sample program...it writes 100 real values multiplied by 3600 rows (360000 values) in a csv file.maybe it gives you an inspiration ?I used he Codesys V3.5SP9Patch5 and the Codesys ControlWINV3 as runtime...csv.JPGtest_csv.projectwollvieh.

Hello rjafrate,Yes, I think so but dont know how to deal with it. I waited till the time out and stopped running, still no file! I plan to try a new idea, OPC communication with matlab. Hope it will work.rjafrate wrote:After writing to the file you need to wait until the write operation is actually performed before closing the file.
