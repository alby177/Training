HelloWhat am I missing with the EXECUTE block?I've put a box in the ladder, but the code inside doesn't execute.ThanksPaul

Hello Paul,I've just tried in with CODESYS V3.5 SP7. It works as expected - the value of HMIInverter... will be copied to MyInverterSpeedCommand if InverterCycling ist FALSE. May be the code in other networks (or in other POUs) changes the InverterCycling somehow?Regards, Roman

Hello RomanThanks for the reply.You are right...I changed the compiler to 3.5.7.0 the EXECUTE block works as expected.My controller's RTE is 3.5.1.40 and this doesn't work (in the simulator anyway).It's a shame as this is very useful.RegardsPaul
