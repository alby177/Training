Hi,How to split up datatime variable?I would like to get day, month, year and time separetly?Thanks

I always convert to string and use the standard functions string RIGHT(), DELETE() etc to isolate them.

Thanks for your answer.

Use CAA DTUTil for Split/Concat DT, Date and TOD.It seems easy then string functions.
