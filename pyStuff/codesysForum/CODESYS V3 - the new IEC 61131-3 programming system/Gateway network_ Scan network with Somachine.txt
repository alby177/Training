I have Somachine V3.0.14.5 and the associate gateway installed in a Windows 7 PC.I have a large network fragmented via router.  When the development machine and the PLC are on the same “subnet” there is no problem.When the PC station and the PLC are on different network, I cannot communicate.After a short analyze of the Ethernet traffic it appear that Via the call “scan network”The first packet send by the gateway is an IP broadcast (I.e, destination mac FF.FF.FF.FF.FF.FF and IP broadcast for me 137.138.255.255) and those type of packets are usually blocked at the router level. Having IP broadcast enable in routers break the network security and gives an open door for DoS attack. We cannot remove this security on tour network site.Via a “add device” and selecting the IP of the PLCUnfortunately, there is not traffic going out of the PC station. I presume that something is wrong or missing in one of my setting.Does someone has an idea on how to connect a development station to a PLC on a routed network without IP broadcast ?Thanks
