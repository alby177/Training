Hi, I have a problem steming from this post viewtopic.php?f=11&t=5550I have developed automated script to open a project. Get the gateway and device address. Then set it before building project and going online. The problem is from time to time the Device Address changes so then my script states cannot log in.Sometimes it has routing information, sometimes it has no routing information, sometimes it has loads of information.I'm using script similar to this:          treeobj.set_gateway_and_address(treeobj.get_gateway(),"009A.A0DE")Is there any other method through scripting to set the device. Or even script to get back all the scanned devices so that I can select the one that is mine. Or any method yet of setting device by IP.Need to fix this urgently so any help much appreciated.
