Hello,I have a problem with the following code:Code:NumberInString : WSTRING(20) := "16#a";Number         : INT;Number := WSTRING_TO_INT(NumberInString);I expect the value decimal 10 but I get the value 37.What am I doing wrong?Thanks in advance for your help.Best regards,Matthias

wstring name is fault and the first character is a 1 giving 37use only the A int he string

Hi Matthias,You should use capital letters. "16#A" will return 10.

Hello TimvH, shooter,thank you for your help.The solution is OK, but I think "a" and "A" should both work.But for now it's OK.Thanks,Matthias
