On Friday I downloaded the XML Utility Demo in hopes to test it out before potentially purchasing the official version. So far I am having trouble using the sample project because the XML library can't be found. I am using a security dongle. The XML library has a unique symbol, as seen below, next to it in the library manager and when clicking "Download Missing Libraries" it always fails.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated as I only have until Friday to use the demo version.*SOLVED*When I downloaded the package I extracted it myself and found the example project within. The correct thing to do is to open Codesys and click Tools->Package Manager and extract it there.
