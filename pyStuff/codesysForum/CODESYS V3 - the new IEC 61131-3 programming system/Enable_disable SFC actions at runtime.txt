Is it possible to control SFC actions at run-time? In particular, access to the qualifier is allowed like this:_MyAction.AC.N := FALSE:If the SFC chart uses IEC actions, and the action qualifier defaults to "N", how can I change the qualifier at run-time to something different, like "R0". My use-case is that I have a SFC function block which is being extended by another FB and implemented in ST. The intent is to stub out each STEP with an action in the base FB, and in the extended FB override (and perhaps call via SUPER^.MyAction) the base FB action if needed.So in the case where the extended FB doesn't care to make use of the action, it is not overridden, but I'd like the base action to not be called either.
