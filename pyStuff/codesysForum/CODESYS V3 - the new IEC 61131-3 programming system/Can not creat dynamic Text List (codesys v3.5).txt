I have a problem with to creat dynamic text list like example error's list.  i select on POU or application and click rightmouse add object but dont see TEXT LIST.does anyone know how can i creat dynamic text list?

Go to the menu: Tools=>Options=>Features. Enable the object "Text List".(maybe you have to restart CoDeSys before it is enabled).To link a graphical object to a dynamic text list you have to enable the "expert" properties (at top of properties view of graphical object).Otherwise this property is not visible.

aaah! hehe found it, thanks you very much.
