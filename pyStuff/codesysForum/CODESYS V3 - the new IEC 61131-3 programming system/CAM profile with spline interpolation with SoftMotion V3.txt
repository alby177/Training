Dear All,I use a CAM profile made by CAM editor; this function require normally a Master Axis (tipical Virtual) and a Slave  (tipical real Axis with gear box).Both Axis must be configure properly using SoftMotion tabs parameter.According to the Master Speed, the Slave will try to follow the Master; is there any library which can control if my Slave (real Axis) is going to run over its physical characteristic (Max Speed or Max torque) due to keep faith to the Master speed?this future could prevent the Slave damages.regards 

hi,think you do not need a library function, what you probably need is the posibilityto add act torque and act velocity of the drive to the cyclic data.If this is possible with your drive, you could monitor these values and stopthe movement if you get values above the allowed torque or velocityWhich drive are you using? (or Which fieldbus)If the drive or the fieldbus does not give the posibilty to add additional cyclic data,an aditional option could be to activate the position lag supervision in the configuration of the drive.Third option is to let the drive supervise the following error (maybe this is already set but allow only few increments for that) and some drives give the posibiblity to add max torque or velocity values before the drive stop the movement with a defined stop deceleration and went into an save state.This option is drive type dependend.cuEdwin
