How can I store the trend data to an SD Card in a PFC200 PLC? (750-1802) I can't seem to find a reference or I'm not searching for the right word. In a previous post, Edwin suggested to store the trend data in the SD card instead of the internal flash to protect the flash from multiple writes - eventually wearing it out. This sounds like a great idea!I'm familiar with Linux. If I know the name of the trend data file, I could create a symbolic link in the OS, but I hope there is a better way. Thanks!

To follow up, I decided to load the PFC200 runtime and application on an SD Card. This way, the trend data is stored on the SD Card and if the SD Card dies because of too many writes, I can replace the SD Card instead of replacing the PLC. Everything seems to be running fine. The PLC is a WAGO 750-8202.

The PLC is a WAGO 750-8202.But if the SD card dies, runtime dies too?.. Or maybe I misunderstand part with "PFC200 runtime and application on an SD Card".

Hi,yes, sorry for the late response... would recommend to work with the runtime out of the internal Flash,but hold the application files on SD Card:you Need to change the following section in /etc/CODESYSControl.cfg or better remove it there an move thes User Parameter to /etc/CODESYSControl_User.cfg [SysFile]PlcLogicPrefix=1PlaceholderFilePath=/media/sd, $PlcLogic$"BREdwin

Thank you. I modified /etc/CODESYSControl.cfg as follows:[SysFile]FilePath.1=/etc/, 3S.datPlaceholderFilePath.1=/media/sd, $PlcLogic$PlaceholderFilePath.1.View=1PlaceholderFilePath.1.Volatile=1PlcLogicPrefix=1The only line I really changed was the first PlaceholderFilePath.1 line. I changed the last parameter from $SDCard$ to $PlcLogic$After a reboot, I see the application, trend and other directories on the SD card. (ls /media/sd)ac_persistence  Application     lost+found      visualarms          _cnc            trendNote, I formatted the SD Card with a single partition and EXT4 file system.
