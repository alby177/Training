I have a type (structure) in my IEC applicationTYPE composite_t :STRUCT                m_i : INT;                m_f : REAL;END_STRUCTEND_TYPEAnd somewhere in application I have an instance of this type:  ct1 : composite_t := ( m_i := 1, m_f := 2 ); I write component which uses CmpIecVarAccess interface, I'd like to get type information.I browse to "ct1" ( hNode is a handle to variable "ct1" ) and then I call:TypeDescAsUnion typeDesc;hTypeNode = IecVarAccGetTypeNode3(hInterface, hNode, &VarInfo, &result);IecVarAccGetTypeDesc(hInterface, hTypeNode, &typeDesc);And as a result I have a valid typeDesc.So the question is: Is it possible having typeDesc to get the name of the type ( i.e. "composite_t" ) ? Not the name of a variable ( "ct1" ) , but the name of a type?I tryed:     char *szTypeName = CAL_IecVarAccGetNodeName(hInterface, hTypeNode, &result);But it doesn't work.

I just got quick response from CoDeSys support ( thank you guys ! ).solution is :IecVarAccGetTypeName( hInterface, hTypeNode, &result)   problem is solved.
