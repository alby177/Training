I'm going to try to get a IO Link master working over Profinet. (Im currently testing it on a Raspberry Pi)To be able to configure the IO Link sensors, I need the acyclic communication to work.=I need to use the functions RDREC and WRREC.For these to work correctly, I need the adress of the I/O module in the form of a DWORDFor Profibus communication there is a functionblock, CommFB.ID, that I have used before.dwAdrID := CommFB.ID(EN := TRUE,			MASTER := PN_Master_ID, 			SEGMENT := BYTE#16#0,  			STATION := iSTATION,        			SLOT := iSLOT); 1) Is acyclic communication implemented of the Raspberry?2) Can I use the CommFB.ID functionblock?3) In that case, how do I find out the STATION number of a Profinet buscoupler?/Marcus

Hi Marcus,check attached project.//acyclic read -serviceCode:IF(execRead) THEN   execRead := FALSE;   rdrec.REQ := TRUE;END_IFrdrec.ID := UR20.ID;rdrec.INDEX := UINT_TO_INT(16#AFF0);      //this is the I&M data, just for demo purposerdrec.RECORD := ADR(buffer);rdrec();rdrec.REQ := rdrec.BUSY;BREdwin

Thanx, somethimes the solution is too simpleI just got the ID of the Profinet buscoupler from the Profinet name (in my case of a Phoenix Contact buscoupler = "il_pn_bk.ID")and with the function IoDrvProfinet.SUBSLOT_ID, I got the IDThanks again Mr Schwellinger/Marcus

Hello,Sorry for mixing this topic with profibus questions: I'm trying to get the acyclic communication working but I can't figure out where to find all information to get the ID used for the function blocks below:RALARM RDIAG RDREC WRREC Scope Name Type Initial Comment Return ID DWORD     Input EN BOOL TRUE   MASTER BYTE   ID of the DP system SEGMENT BYTE   Number of the DP segment STATION BYTE   Number of the DP-slave(station address) SLOT BYTE   Slot numberThe station byte is the slave dp address but where do I find the values for the rest?`I'm running with the EL6731 Profibus master from Beckhoff./Martin
