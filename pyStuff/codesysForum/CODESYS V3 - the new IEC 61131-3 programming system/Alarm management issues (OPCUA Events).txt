Hi.I just spotted a couple of glitches on alarm management (I'm on 3.5.12.0 version):1) Even though I added CmpOPCUAProviderAlarmConfiguration library, alarms triggered as Events do not map as expected in OPC UA Events: taking into consideration columns shown on AlarmGroup configuration, neither Class nor Message are shown on OPCUA-client side, making useless such feature (any event will be rendered same way). I'm using UaExpert OPC-UA client. I suppose this bug has been introduced recently, since on screenshots depicted in help guide anything works as expected.2) Input Assistant does not detect AlarmGroup objects, so it does not suggest AlarmGroup IDs in variable section. Same feature but related to Alarm classes IDs works as expected.
