Hi,I'm Stefan and totally new to CODESYS and PROFINET, but hope my question is not too dum.I try to connect an Endress+Hauser RSG45 via PROFINET to Control Win V3.  (GSDML is installed)I do add the PN-Controller and search for devices. My device is found and I am able to set Name and IP.That's about as far as I can get. What I see in the "Search devices" window is an error at column "Ident-Nr." Attachment:Search devices dialog.pngIn Device Log, I can see the following error for every "Search" Attachment:LogError.pngThat's the device info in Repository:Attachment:Repository.pngDoes anybody have an idea?ThanksStefan
