I'm debugging my library. I can set breakpoints during debugging. This works well. I have the problem with the setting breakpoint in function which is run ones at begin program. When I login, application stop and I can toggle breakpoint but when I click start, the program does not stop at this breakpoint. It looks like some part of the code (where the breakpoint exists) is executed after login.

Hi.All initialization code (all fb_init for example) is executed before run, and as I can know it is not possible to make an breakpoint.I had the same problem with a library, and I solved it using log messages

Josep, thank you very much for your reply.Could you give advice how can I use log messages?

Hi.See this discussionviewtopic.php?t=7517
