HelloI'm a CoDeSys beginner. I already found for some of my previous problems solutions in this forum. Maybe you can help me with my current problem.As hardware I am using  the MTX-Control from Bosch Rexroth. It is a CNC with integrated CoDeSys V3 PLC.I want to search a file in a directory. If this file is available, I want to create a new folder and copy this file into this folder. Additionally I want to delete an old folder which contains old files.I've included alread the SysFile.lib but with this lib I can only copy a file, but I cannot search a file, delete one or create a new folder.Does someone know which library I have to include for this purpose? And how an example code must look like?I hope you can help me.Thank youMartin

HelloI found a library which is able to delete folders and copy files.I added the following two libraries CAA File 3.5.9.0 andFile Acces 3.5.7.0And created DirRemove, which I want to use to remove a folder.Code:varDirRemove : File.DirRemove;End_VarBut if I want to start the simulation on my programming pc I get an error message:Error during download15 unresolved referencesThe device version on the hardware seems to be different from the device version used in the project. Try to up-/downgrade the device in the project to match the actual version on the hardware.In the messages window I get 15 additional errors:ID                DescriptionTaskList        Unresolve Reference: 'Ticks_GETTICK'...and so onDoes someone know what I can do?
