Is there any way to get the memory size occupied by a particular function block or a structure of data in Codesys?

Way I know:  Create an array of your function block - at least two elements.  Define 2 pointers (“POINTER TO MyFb”).  Set first pointer to ADR(FbInst[0]) and second pointer = ADR(FbInst[1]]).  The difference will be the byte size.

Hi,why not just using Code:SIZEOF(...)?
