HelloIs there a way to know, in a program the status of the bus Mobbus TCP, the status of the master, the status of a slave, if an element is connected or not.I read documentation about CAA_DeviceDiagnostic.lib, but it is not very clear for me   I use the name of a slave in status windows, i see many helpfull inofrmations, but I can't uses it in my program.Thank you in advance for your answers. 

HelloNobody uses Modbus TCP or rather diagnostic information?   Please Mr. CODESYS gives us more readable and useful docs with real examples.   

It is easy the modbus items are objects.  Do the following by using the name of the object:Modbus_TCP_Master.xSlaveErrorModbus_TCP_Master.uiConnectedSlavesModbus_TCP_Slave.byModbusErrorModbus_TCP_Slave.xBusyModbus_TCP_Slave.xConfirmErrorModbus_TCP_Slave.xErrorModbus_TCP_Slave.xInitDoneBR

Is there a proper working example available for Modbus TCP and other comms?
