Hello!I have a question about the compiling prosess, more spesific generating the hex file. in a Bosch Rexroth Bodas Design applicationWhen I activate the rebuild function the program starting the compiling prosess and generates the HEX file.But for some reason it becomes uncomplete and gets a "RUN HEX" ending at the file name....!When I try to flash the file into the device it goes fine without errors, but as I mention earlier it misses som parameters..!As you probably understand I am a newbe to this and I hope someone could give me some advice what is wrong here?Please take a look at the enclosed doc.Thanks in advance
