Hello CodeSys Team,I built a ModBus test-Server to test our Python Written Modbus Client. The test-Server needs special Adresses for Input registers and Holding registers. Unfortunately the manual settings at the mapped variables in the "Modbus TCP Slave Device E/A Abbild" does not really change the register addresses. I only can set them to a fix value for both (Input and Holding) in the "Allgemein" Settings.But I need following addresses:Holding register:200 - 20210400 - 10404Input register:100 - 10310900 - 10910How I can do this? In V2.3 i used to simply declare the Words at the given address.I attached my project and a simple pymodbus script. In the current configuration it works - but I need the Holding register offset at address 200...Thanks in advance for the help Mario

Hi,you could only specify the startadress:Holding register:200 - 20210400 - 10404 - this is not possible to have gap, they are in one blockInput register:100 - 10310900 - 10910 - this is not possible to have gap here,, they are in one blockand I do not really understand why you need this.. just pimp you pyton to have this in one block either...?BREdwin

Hi Edwin,in need the two blocks to simulate 2 different ModBus Server our client needs to connect to. But if it is not possible I will make 2 ModBus-Test-Server.But I cannot type the start adresses I need in the fields as you did. The program only accepts 100 as maximum in both fields?Seems to me you have another version of the ModBus-Slave? I have this version:Name: ModbusTCP Slave DeviceHersteller: 3S - Smart Software Solutions GmbHKategorien: ModbusTCP Slave Ger√§tTyp: 115ID: 0000 0002Version: 3.5.9.0Bestellnummer: -Beschreibung: A device that works as a Modbus TCP Slave.Version Konfiguration 3.5.1.0best regards Mario
