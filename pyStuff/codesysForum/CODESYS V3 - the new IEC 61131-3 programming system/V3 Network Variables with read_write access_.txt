Hi,I'm new to codesys and I have a question in regards to how to synchronize network variable lists. I have one device programmed in v2.3 (PLC) and one on 3.5 (HMI). I would like to have a variable list that updates if changes are made on either device. I read that read/write lists are discouraged and in 3.5 it can't be set up anymore, apparently. You have to pick one or the other.I have a variable of the type real on the PLC and I want the HMI to display that, let's say a retain. But I also want to be able to change that value through the HMI.Is that possible in one list or do I have to make the HMI field read from one variable and write to another? (Which I believe is not possible in 2.3)What is the best practice approach for that? Or even for a pure v3.5 environment with separated transmit and receive lists?I found a video but that was v2.3 with all variable lists configured as read/write and the HMI would simply change the value itself and redistribute the value to the other nodes.Kind RegardsHeinz
