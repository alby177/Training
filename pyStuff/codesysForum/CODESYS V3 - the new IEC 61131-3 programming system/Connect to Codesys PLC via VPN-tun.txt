Dear Sir or Madam,Status:In our company we use LTi Servo controllers, wich include a Codesys PLC.- Our company network is something like: 192.168.33.x- Machine subnet ist: 192.168.44.y- With a NAT on the machine's gateway, we can access every item of the 192.168.44.y subnet, by connecting to 10.A.B.y from anywhere inside our company. (Where A.B is the machine's number)[For remote maintenance of our machines remote we use a VPN server, which every online machine connects to.In order to connect to any PC/drive/... without further configuration the 10.0.0.0 subnet is redirected to the VPN server.]- We can connect to the server controllers over TCP (with the vendor's "drive manager" software)Questions:1. How would we need to configure CoDeSyS gateway (with the gateway running on the same PC in the company subnet) to access the servo  a) over UDP (Error: no adapter with the subnet ... found)  b) over TCPwithout broadcast traffic?Greetings from Austria,Team
