Hi,I am using CoDeSys V3.5 SP6(Trial)I am testing a simple program in SFC. For the first time there were no pre-compilation errors and run satisfactorily. Then I run a relatively big project(Traffic Light project - where there was a FB from SFC) and after closing the big project, I run the simple program again. Now its showing 115 errors. Suddenly the errors pops-up from nowhere. Is that a instability problem of Trial version? Is there a good solution? Here are the screen shots: Thanks in advance   https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Byxb1JBOD4gmQTBrQk9DMzJTNnc/view?usp=sharinghttps://drive.google.com/file/d/0Byxb1JBOD4gmLUtIRl9jQzQxZjg/view?usp=sharinghttps://drive.google.com/file/d/0Byxb1JBOD4gmWjFSbVR4eUh2Y2M/view?usp=sharing

Now surprisingly the program is running without any error message and without any modification. Here is the Screen Shot.https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Byxb1JBOD4gmbEdnN19DVVlZOTA/view?usp=sharingSo, I think probably there is a bug in the compiler/linker for SFC.
