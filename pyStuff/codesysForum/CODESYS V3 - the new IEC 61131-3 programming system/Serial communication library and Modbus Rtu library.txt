HelloRt 3.5.7.10I can use the Modbus RTU library without problem to talk to Modbus slaves.I have now added the serial communication library to use another serial port (not modbus).When I open this port, the modbus dies after 1 minute (error 162, CRC error)If I don't open the new port then the modbus comms is happy for 'ever'.Any suggestions?Paul

Further information to Paul/Codesys:Paul is running Codesys on a Beijer Electronics TxB SoftControl master, runtime v3.5.7.10.I am able to reproduce the error in my office. I get Modbus going, all is fine, then I open a completely different port using the COM.Open block. This causes the Modbus to fail after a certain time, always around 55s.However, if I try using a PC with Codesys RTE v3.5.9.40 or a Beijer Electronics X2 Control, runtime v3.5.9.50, then everything works fine.So... the error seems to be related to either Codesys SP7 or the TxB SoftControl itself.Request to Codesys:Please check JIRA logs for anything related to this between SP7 Patch 1 and SP9 Patch 4 and Beijer Electronics will continue investigating how ports are handled by the old TxB master.EDIT:If I open the other port from an external program it works fine, so I guess the issue is related to internal issues within Codesys after all.Kim HansenBeijer Electronics Products AB
