In my project I have many parameters that needs to be in a recipe and also to be transferred via communication (Ethernet/IP) to slave devices.Is it OK to use the same variables for both the recipe and the communication or should I use two different sets of variables (one for the recipe and one for the communication)?

You should be able to use the same variables for the recipe values and to send those values over the communication channel.  However, you may want to use a set of temporary variables for loading your recipe to preview it or alter it before going "live" with the values.  Otherwise, a user cannot change his mind (the old recipe values are lost as soon as you load one).It may be seen as duplication or wasteful, but I prefer to define an array specifically for the communication channel and create one Program that is called every PLC scan that maps program variables to/from the array (especially for Modbus).  That way, I am sure of my data order (data[1], data[2], etc) while still using descriptive variables in my code (CmdSpeed, ActSpeed, FeedRate, etc).
