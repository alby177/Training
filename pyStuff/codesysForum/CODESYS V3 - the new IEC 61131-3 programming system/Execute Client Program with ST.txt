Hello Team. I've spent the day reading through the forums to seek a solution to my problem. Perhaps I have missed something obvious which is why a solution eludes me... I'm trying to run an executable file through my program POU. This is what I've done so far.Code:CODESYSControl.cfg[SysProcess]Command=AllowAll[SysFile]Windows.WorkingDirectory=C:\ProgramData\CODESYS\CODESYSControlWinV3x64\801BFF8CAND Code:  command1 : STRING := 'C:\OpenGL\GUIproject\Release\GUIproject.exe'Code:IF xExecuteSysP THEN   xExecuteSysP := FALSE;   (*SysProcess.SysProcess Execute Command( pszComand:= command1,  pResult := ADR(Result));*)   SysProcess.SysProcessCreate(pszApplication := command2, pszCommandLine := command1, ulHide := 0, pResult := ADR(Result) );END_IFPS: I made a button to launch the executable through the visualization and that works, so the file and the path are fine. I get no compile errors either and the rest of the program seems to run fine. I'm working on Windows 7, in a simulation as I do not have access to a device just yet.Note: The commented solution did not work either.

Hi,why not using the installed Control Win runtime?BREdwin

Thank you kindly for your response! This was the obvious flaw in my program that I failed to understand. In hindsight it makes perfect sense that to perform commands you need to be logged into a device.... Everything is working now. Thank you again.
