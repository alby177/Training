hI,                       We  have implemented shared memory in Codesys environment. This  application is downloaded on to the  QNX based Power PC target. Another  QNX application  is accessing the  same shared memory. We are writing data from Codesys application on to the shared memory and reading the same from the QNX  application successfully.There seems to be no clash in  writing and reading from different applications.But we  understand that some synchronization mechanism has to be used to avoid  simultaneous access of shared memory.How can we implement this from the codesys application  and achieve the  synchronization.?Can you provide any examples which will  help us understand it. What are the libraries to be use in the same?With regards,praveena
