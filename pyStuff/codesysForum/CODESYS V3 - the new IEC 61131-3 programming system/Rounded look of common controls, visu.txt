Hello!I'm using V3.5 and in my visualization are common contols (buttons, slider, table) 'old' looking rectangular and grey. I found VisuDemoV3 project in instalatin folder. In this project are common controls very 'new' looking rounded and blue. I can not find where to change in my projects to have that 'new' looking visu elements...Where to change/switch it?It is posible to adapt this newstyle or I have to change everything, somewhere?Regards,Alex

I think that the two projects are using different "Style settings".  It is possible to change this in the Visualization Manager.

Thanks kberlin!You were right is it simple to change styles via visu-manager, I was changing it over tools>options>visu. styles, but no effect.regardsalex
