Is it possible to use the same functionnality we had with V2.3 to upload a programm?I do not find any information on the new V3 for this. 

Yes, this is possible. Through the menu "file" you can do an upload and download of the source.Through the menu "Project" => "Project settings" you can choose which additional files can be downloaded and when the source files should be (automatically) downloaded.
