HelloWhen setting a slave channel, we can choose a trigger ; Cyclc, Rising Edge or Application.With Application, what FB (or other thing) should we use ?With the same, for a Modbus serial slave, J use ModbusChannel FB and it works well.On line help, doesn't mention this possibility (Application).   Thank you in advance for your help.  

Hi,Each defined modbus channel of a slave can be triggered by a function block with the usual inputs (xExecute) and outputs (xError, errorCode etc..) The channel that is to be executed is referenced by the index of the channel (as displayed in the Modbus-Slave configurator's channel-page. The latter one gets a new column with the Channel-index (same value that is used for referencing the channel in the application) There's an additional new Trigger "Application" for the channels.BREdwin

Hi Edwin,"ModbusChannel" works well with Modbus RTU slave.But with Modbus RTU, when I build my project with variable declaration Channel1:ModbusChannel;I get an error : Identifier 'ModbusChannel' not defined.When I search the word "ModbusChannel" into the library manager it found the library IoDrvModbusTCP, (already installed), but when I look inside this library (into the library manager) I don't see "ModbusChannel" !! (And I got news glasses last week !!   )BRJAPIB

Hi,which Version are you using exactly?BREdwin
