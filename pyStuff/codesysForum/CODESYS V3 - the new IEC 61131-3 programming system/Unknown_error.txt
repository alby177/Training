Hello everyone, I want your help to understand this error, anyone have an idea?I looked for this variable in my program but it doesn't exist...how can i run my program? This program is very serious for me and I need your help pleaseRT esse

Try a "clean" (see the Build menu).

I've just tried it but I get the same mistake...  ...Should I try the clean all option? I should mention the fact that my program give me an error in the start that cannot convert UINT to USINT because I use an open COM fb...Can anyone help with the situation?

Anyone who can help me....?It's very complicated I think...Is there a way to see program's implicit variables?...What exactly is segment size...I am very confused
