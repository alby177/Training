Ive figured out how to insert a "box" on to a CFC type POU, but after setting it to lets say "TON" I was expecting to see the pins appear.How do I reset teh box to show the pins? (I use the term reset, as its on the menu when I right click on the box).I am trying to write a component that allows logic to be written straight to a POU, and I have not foound any documentation on how to do this, so I am making random guesses at the moment.I am using the following to add the box on the CFC POUprivate _3S.CoDeSys.CFCObject.ICFCElement add_cfc_box(_3S.CoDeSys.CFCObject.ICFCImplementationObject2 impl, _3S.CoDeSys.CFCObject.KindOfCall type, string name, string instance, System.Drawing.Rectangle bound)        {            _3S.CoDeSys.CFCObject.ICFCItem4 item = ComponentManager.Singleton.CreateInstance(objects_ids.GUID_CFCBOXELEMENT) as _3S.CoDeSys.CFCObject.ICFCItem4;            _3S.CoDeSys.CFCObject.ICFCElement2 elem = item as _3S.CoDeSys.CFCObject.ICFCElement2;            elem.KindOfCall = type;            // name            _3S.CoDeSys.CFCObject.ICFCText Name = ComponentManager.Singleton.CreateInstance(objects_ids.GUID_CFCTEXT) as _3S.CoDeSys.CFCObject.ICFCText;            Name.Text = name;            elem.Texts.Add(Name);            // instance                        _3S.CoDeSys.CFCObject.ICFCText Instance = ComponentManager.Singleton.CreateInstance(objects_ids.GUID_CFCTEXT) as _3S.CoDeSys.CFCObject.ICFCText;            Instance.Text = instance;            elem.Texts.Add(Instance);            // position            item.Bounds = bound;            impl.Items.Add(item);            return elem;}

I'm just guessing, but maybe you haven't added the standard library to your project yet.Then the compiler doesn't know about TON yet and doesn't know which inputs / outputs it has.

The library is already part of the project. I can add by hand in the editor. Also, the box I insert, if I double click on it,it correctly shows me information about it being a Timer, so I know the compiler understands what the block is used for.
