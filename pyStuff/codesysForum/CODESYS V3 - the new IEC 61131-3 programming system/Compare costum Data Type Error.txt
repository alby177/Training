Any news?You think is better we stay with Development 3.5.9.50 until fount any solution?

Hi,give me some time sorry, the workaround is for sure to switch back only the compiler version to 3.5SP9xand stay in current CODESYS version, but let us investigate the reason for this.BREdwin

Hello,this is an error in the older Versions 3.5.8.0 and3.5.9.0 do not Report an compile error even they should do:Reason:CDS-29747: After thorough investigation we decided not to implement this feature:a typical structure contains gaps due to alignment reasons, those gaps are not initialized and do not have a predefined value and should not have a predefined value. Therefore it is not possible to compare structures with a memcmp-function that does not know the internal structure of a structure.The programmer write compare functions for those structures were the compare is needed.BREdwin

That is very bad.Did you understand how much work we need to do if we want our customers to stay updated for all our projects?
