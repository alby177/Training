Hi,I need a way to use sems on my V3.4.2.0 arm-linux target.Using SysSemProcess lib makes segmentation fault when attempting to start the runtime, I think the lib might not be implemented on Linux in my current runtime version.Using SysSem, SysSemEnter or SysSemTry always return ERR_OK, no matter if the sem is locked or not!Code:IF pSemHandle^ = RTS_INVALID_HANDLE THEN   pSemHandle^ := SysSemCreate(ADR(semCreateResult));END_IFsemTryResult:=SysSemTry(pSemHandle^);semEnterResult:=SysSemEnter(pSemHandle^);pSemHandle is a pointer to a udint declared in a GVL.Obviously I have more code that later releases the sem when not needed anymore, but my problem is that I cannot check if the resource is free or not!I dont what to use SW FB for that because I want to make sure that the P and V functions will be "atomic".Anyone had any luck with this lib on an arm-linux target?Thanks!

There is an old bug report CDS-7499 that just says "Linux: Semaphores are not working correctly". But I think it would be best if you contacted 3S support directly.Best regards,Kristian Berlin

Which Linux distro are you using? I noticed that Codesys (V. 3.4.x.x) Semaphores work if your Linux supports POSIX IPC Semaphores, but not with System V semaphores. Your Linux distro should support POSIX if you can find /dev/shm directory.

Interesting point, I am running linux-davinci, which support POSIX sems.I compiled a small c application that uses semaphores.h and sem_init, wait, post, destroy to test on the target and it runs smoothly, so I gess I'll have to upgrade my runtime to make it works.Anyway, thanks for your help!

Hi       I would like to know whether codesys can be used for programming embedded controllers and can I know one example how it is done for this linux and one embedded applicationThanks

To use CoDeSys on your own embedded controller, you will need the CoDeSys Runtime Toolkit.Together with 3S-Smart Software Solutions you can then implement and adapt the runtime to your hardware.Please contact the sales team of 3S-Smart Software Solutions for further information.

Thanks for the info.Can I you give me a link for any existing embedded controller using codesys.It will be helpful for me. 

I don't understand exactly what you mean:- If you want to buy an existing controller which can be programmed with CoDeSys you can go to the CoDeSys Device Directory and search http://www.3s-software.com/index.shtml? ... _directory- If you want to build your own controller you could choose any platform. See http://www.3s-software.com/index.shtml?en_CoDeSysSP_OEM (click on Linux) to see the details and requirements.I cannot advise you which platform is best.
