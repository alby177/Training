Hi!I am experiencing this issue for quite a long time and now it started to stress me out. Whenever i include in my codesys programme only one icon (of any format - tested with bmp, jpg, png) the icon causes some of the visualization elements disappearing.I am using -> CODESYS V3.5 SP8 Patch 3 <- on Sontheim eControl micro PLC. The compiler doesn't throw any errors and also working logic is fine, but visualization looks pretty ugly because PLC starts to cut some of the elements and some are even disappearing. I don't know, did I forget to do any settings modifications in codesys or is this the PLC issue... I don't know. I am adding some images to show you my problems. I added only one icon (1kb) in programme and the problem is showing immediately.Thanks for the answer in advance.Silvester
