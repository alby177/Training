The following Help section for Data Type > Structure implies that it is possible to compare structures: "If the target system supports the data type, as from compiler version >= 3.5.7.0 you can compare operands of type STRUCT (structure). Example: IF (stStruct1 := stStruct2) THEN...." . (I assume this is a typo and should read IF (struct1 = struct2) THEN ...)Using Control Win V3 Version 3.5.7.10, I have:TYPE TestDUT :STRUCT	MyInt: INT;END_STRUCTEND_TYPEVAR	struct1: TestDUT;	struct2: TestDUT;	testBool: BOOL;END_VARIF (struct1 = struct2) THEN	testBool := TRUE;END_IFThis generates the error:Cannot compare type 'TestDUT' with type 'TestDUT'Have I made an error or is this feature not supported on the target system?

Hinot sure that you could still compare structure directly. But you could do it with pointers, using the Sysmemcmp function in library Sysmem. 	pstruct1: POINTER TO BYTE;	pstruct2: POINTER TO BYTE;       pstruct1 := ADR(struct1);       pstruct2 := ADR(struct2);IF sysmemcmp(pstruct1,pstruct2, SIZEOF(struct1)) <> 0 THEN	testBool := TRUE;ELSE	testBool := FALSE;	END_IFsomething as above

Great, that's exactly what I need, thanks.
