Hello,  How to rotate a object in design time in visualzation. Normally other software will have the options of Rotate right.Rotate left,Rotate 90,180,270 Options.Is there any options like that available in codesys like that. I can't find any tools like that.

HelloTo rotate an objet you have to use the propertie : absolute movement -rotation.If you write 100, the objet will rotate clock wise.The rotation center is the small white cross in a black circle, you deplace. A line will turn around the center, a rectangle will move around the center while remaining horizontal.To rotate a rectangle and the text inside, use the propertie : internal rotation.Try properties  

in design time you can not rotate an object, old item).in running only a polygon can be rotated.a rectangle can not be rotated in running.

Thank you for reply

Hi,since CODESYS V3.5 SP4 you can now rotate every object.In the category "Absolute Movement" there is now a new option "inner rotation". If you choose this you can rotate every object, even BMPs.

Hello,I may be missing something here, but I don't see the "Interior Rotation" for an image, despite running 3.5.9.4 or even 3.5.10.Is there a trick to get the "Interior rotation" field shown?
