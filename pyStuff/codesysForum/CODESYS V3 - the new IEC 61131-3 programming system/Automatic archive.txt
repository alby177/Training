Hi,Is there a way to make automatic project archive, or have a pop up asking if you want to make a project archive when closing CODESYS?Nobody remembers to do this when it's a manual task, and i want the backup system to have the latest version in an archive.

write ur   script code and include in ur programe. it does Pop up message when ever you Close it.
