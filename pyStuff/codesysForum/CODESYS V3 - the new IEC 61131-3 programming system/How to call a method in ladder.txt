Hi all,I cannot figure out how to call a method in ladder.I have a FB containing an action in ladder. In this action I want to call a method using the THIS pointer.In ST I would just need to write this:  THIS^.myMethod()How can I do this in ladder?I usually use ST but in this particular case I wanted to use ladder.Thank you.

Hi yannickasselin1,this will work in Ladder too.Regards,Roman

Thanks, it works.I also figured out that using an empty box with EN and just put the method name in it also works.Don't even need to put the THIS^ on top of it.
