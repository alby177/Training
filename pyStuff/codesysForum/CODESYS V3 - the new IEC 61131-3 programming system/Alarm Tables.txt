I would like to know to make a history of alarms. I can only watch current state of alarm. Something like this:Time  Message Value16:30 event   True16:45 event   True16:50 event   TrueI can only see the last one(at 16:50) in the table.

What is historic type of alarm table? I don't see any difference between this and normal one. Is there any posibility to save alarms? Maybe storage option? What are your experience with that? Is it working?

I just get a stdlogger.csv file on my PLC but the folder where it has to put alarm storage is empty. I got the next error in stdlogger.csv file:<loggername>StdLogger</loggername><logoptions>"	<enable>1</enable>""	<type>normal</type>""	<timestamp>rtc</timestamp>""	<deactivatable>0</deactivatable>""	<dump>always</dump>""	<filter>0x0000001f<filter>""	<maxentries>1000</maxentries>""	<maxfiles>3</maxfiles>""	<maxfilesize>5000</maxfilesize>"</logoptions><entries>Timestamp, CmpId, ClassId, ErrorId, InfoId, InfoText</entries>1381322668, 0x00001012, 4, 0, 0, Database Error in method WriteToStorage: Error code = 30437, Action = 1030	...........

In a Control Win V3.5.3.60 application it works.Some tips:- create a button which can toggle a boolean variable. Connect this variable to the Alarm List to toggle between realtime / historical.- Don't forget to set check the option "Archiving" in the Alarm Class (top left in Alarm Class configuration)- Add the Alarm Storage object to the alarm manager.- Set the correct Subdirectory (I don't know what this should be on your device)If it doesn't work I advise you to contact your PLC vendor.

I'm using codesys 3.5.2.0. So that might be the problem if this version doesn't support history in alarm tables? I've set all the options you mentioned, but i'm not sure about the right directory. There might be the problem if i'm not saving a storage file to the correct folder on my PLC?

It works now. It seems there was a problem with the compiler version. I updated it to 3.5.2.10.

Hello, I know that your subject is old but do you remember what kind of subdirectory I have to put in the AlarmStorage please  ? My thanks in advance.

I know this topic is old but I've exactly the same problemewith the message: Database Error in method WriteToStorage: Error code = 30437, Action = 1030	So if someone has other ideaMany thanks in advance
