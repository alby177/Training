HI, I have install the new version WAGO 750-8202 (...FW02 or .FW03) taget files, but , the old style WAGO PLC 750-8202 (maybe FW01)program cannot be rebuilt successfully due to the taget file upgrading. the error is "ERROR 3700 :STRING_TO_ASCIIBYTE(1): A POU WITH NAME 'STRING_TO_ASCIIBYTE' is already in library 'Standard.LIB' "so , if I removed the new 750-8202 target files, how to recovery the old target file?the supplier said only need to re-install the codesys software for old target file recovery.Is there any other way to solve???thanks

Hi,hm I could not really help on this topic (guess you need to ask the Wago support)But why not use this PFC200 with CODESYS V3 on this PFC200 ?How to do this?You need to download the CODESYS Development System (free of charge) http://store.codesys.com/engineering/codesys.htmlAfter installing CODESYS you should download the PFC200 Package by click on the cart in CODESYS,Login to the Store and download/install the package there. to do this by WebBrowser is possible too, then install the Package by the CODESYS PackageManager here:http://store.codesys.com/systeme/codesy ... 00-sl.html  How to install the CODESYS V3 plc runtime on the PFC200 (PFC200 is delivered by default with Wago CODESYS V2.3 or e!COCKBIT runtime) this we need to replace.If you Need to switch back to V2.3 or e!Cockbit this is possible without problems. You need to connect the PFC200 to the same network than your CODESYS PC is connected.Then execute the Update PFC200 command under Tools in CODESYS. Scan your PFC200 and give as login credentials: (default from wago)Which features are supported/licensed by the CODESYS PFC200CANopen_MasterCANopen_SlaveEtherCAT_MasterEthernet_IP_MasterEthernet_IP_SlaveJ1939Modbus_Serial_MasterModbus_Serial_SlaveModbus_TCP_MasterModbus_TCP_SlaveOPC UA ServerProfinet_ControllerProfinet_DeviceRemoteTargetVisu (Fullsceen HMI on an Windows PC connected to PFC200)WebVisu (Visualisation in every Browser html5 based no JAVA Visu – run on Android and iPhone too) BREdwin

Hello Edwin,Thank you very much for your detailed explanation .so far ,we don't have plan to update the Codesys version to V3.5,  we still use the v2.3 because we worry about the new version will not support the old PLC production in according with requirement for maintenance.

Hi,you should think about this:https://www.codesys.com/the-system/versions.htmlCODESYS V2.3 - CODESYS V3Today, the entire CODESYS development, all product extensions and product innovations are based on CODESYS V3. However, many devices that are programmable with CODESYS V2.3 are being used daily. To be prepared for modern machine concepts and future demands, CODESYS V3 was developed on a new technological basis and is the core of an extensive product portfolio. In addition to the established programming options, object-oriented programming (OOP) is supported as a programming option. This makes the CODESYS Development System the first programming tool that implements extensions to OOP according to the newest release of the IEC 6113-3. Furthermore, the entire CODESYS Development System is modular in design. Users can integrate suitable plug-in components into the tool. Such components can be found e.g. in the CODESYS Store. Device manufacturers have the possibility to use the established editors, compilers or configurations to seamlessly extend their own, device-specific software. Automation manufacturers deliver the CODESYS version fitting to your device. Devices that are based on CODESYS V2.3 cannot be programmed with CODESYS V3, due to the technological innovations mentioned above. CODESYS V2.3 will be maintained with bug fixing until end of 2019, future Windows versions will be supported until end of 2016. BREdwin
