What is the easiest way to communicate from a .NET or C++ application to read and write variables in CoDeSys?I have used ADS communication library from Beckhoff in the past to read and write variables in TwinCat.Is there something similar in CoDeSys?

You could use the PLCHandler for this.http://www.codesys.com/products/codesys ... ndler.htmlThis is not free of charge. Contact your local distributor or 3S-Smart Software Solutions for the price.
