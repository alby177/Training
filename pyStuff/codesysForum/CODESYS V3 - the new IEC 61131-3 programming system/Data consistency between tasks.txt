All,What is the 'default' method to synchronize tasks, to get data consistency?Regards,Edwin.

Semaphores? When one task starts to manipulate data, it sets semaphore to block others accessing it, and when it is done it leaves it and releases the semaphore / data for others.Check SysSem or SysSemProcess libraries.BR.,Jay

Thank you.
