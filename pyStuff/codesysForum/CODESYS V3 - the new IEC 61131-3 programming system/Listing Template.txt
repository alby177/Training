I'm trying to use the Project > Document function, but can't find any way to change the font/tab size to allow a single line of code to print on a single print line.At present it prints over two making the listing hard to follow as well as taking twice as much paper.

Hi,All I can seem to adjust are the heading levels and the table of contents, not the actual listing... I'm using the Eaton XSOFT 3.5.8 version of the editor.PJE
