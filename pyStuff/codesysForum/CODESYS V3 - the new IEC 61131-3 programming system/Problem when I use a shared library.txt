Hello,I am creating a library with a C implemented library, a shared library *.so, but I have some problems.Help file said: Quote:Input of a file that matches the Device and can be loaded by the operating system as a dynamic object, for example for Windows: *.dll, for Linux: *.soPlease note: The file *.dll must contain the title of the library project in its name. Example: if the library project has name XYlib, then the Object File must be called: <name>_XYlib.dllMy project name is smBus.library Shared library name is leikb_smBus.soSo, what is wrong??? Any advice?Thank you in advance.
