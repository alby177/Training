Hello!Can I get information about the return codes of the CoDeSys V3 installer? For example when I install CoDeSys V3.5 SP 3 Patch 6 and in case when it wants to restart the PC and I select manual restart later, it finishes with code 3010. I need to know all return codes to be able to handle them in my installer, who calls the CoDeSys V3 installer. By the way, can I start the installer with a specific command line option to disable this dialog? This is not the end of the complete installation and it would be enough if I get information only from the return value, so I can offer restart of the PC on the real end of the installation.
