Hi everyone,I'm working on codesys V3.5.8 and I have this error message: "Connection denied by device: All available communication channels are already in use"My plc is on a switch and it communicate with a touchscreen and I made a vizu, now I m not able to etablish a connection with this PLCI can ping it, I can reach it with fttP://AdresseIP ; I can see the vizu and the touhcscreen still communicate with itI saw on a board that I had to add this line in CODESYSCONTROL.cfg [CmpChannelServer] Buffersize=1600000 MaxChannels=8I added it at the end of the file but it's still not workingSo if someone knows what I have to doMany thanks in advanceDom

Hi,you should solve the root cause: Identify the program/application which does not release the channelsin a correct way.First I would check in the plc shell which applications are connected:Usually one of them does not close the communication channels in a proper way.BREdwin

Thank you for your quickanswerIt's since I've added the visu that I'm not able anymore to etablish a connection with my PLC, I make a trial with channel Info, it has worked 2 times and after the third time, I had this error message:Attachment:mix.pngBut if I'm plug directly in my plc (so I unplug all the other devices), I can etablish a connection with itAny other idea?

I continue my investigationI've a switch with 1 TS, My plc and the network, if I try to etablish a connection here, it doesn't work but if I unplug the network, it worksThe weirdest thing? I changed nothing in my hardware configuration and before it was working without any problemThe only thing I change I change my codesys version to 3.5.7 to 3.5.8

Hi,maybe these are are old bugs which have been already fixed in newer version.Do you have the chance to update your runtime and CODESYS Development System to currrent version (3.5SP10Patchx).BREdwin
