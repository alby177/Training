Hello I am currently writing a library in which I have following structsCode:TYPE Input_com:   STRUCT      In_bit ARRAY [0..15] OF BIT;      In_Word ARRAY [0..10] OF WORD;      In_Float ARRAY [0..10] OF REAL   END_STRUCT;END_TYPETYPE Com_protocol:   STRUCT      inputData     AT%I*           : Input_com;                ......   END_STRUCT;END_TYPEMy library includes getters/setters for reading/writing into the members of the struct.  But nevertheless, when a user is adding my library into his project, he must define a variable of  Com_protocol Type for setting up the address of the inputs Code:VAR     ST_InComm  : PKR.Com_protocol;  // (PKR is the namespace)END_VARThus, he can directly read data from the struct (and indirectly from the Inputs).  This is something I would like to avoid because of safety reason, I would like to force him using the dedicated 'getters'Is there a way to do this ?I would appreciate any help on that matter.kurvanov
