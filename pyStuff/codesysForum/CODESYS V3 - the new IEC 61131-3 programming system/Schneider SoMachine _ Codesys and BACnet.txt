I haven't been able to find a BACnet implementation for Schneider SoMachine, so I started working of some software myself.  I have the basic program written in ST.  Functions like poll for master, etc, and token passing are working, as well as readProperty/writeProperty.  The attached screenshot shows a wireshark capture of a BACnet MS/TP network over serial at 38400 baud, passing the token and reading a point.  Is anyone else interested in collaborating on a library for this?  The BACnet standard is quite extensive, and I'm starting with just basic read/writes of present values, but I see no reason it couldn't expand into a full implementation with a couple people working on it.Tim
