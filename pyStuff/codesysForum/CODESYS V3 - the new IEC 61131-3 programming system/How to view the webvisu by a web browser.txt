Currently I use the simulation mode in my PC and I have make a webvisu. But I don't know the IP address to view this webvisu. I try localhost but it doesn't work. So Could some one tell me how to view the webvisu in a web browser.

Hi,The path for webvisu running on your local PC would be : http://localhost:8080/webvisu.htm where:* 8080 is the default port for visulaisation* webvisu.htm is the name of the html file containing the start visualisationNote; webvisu.htm is configured by adding the object "WebVisualisation" to the Visualisation Manager. See CODESYS Visualization > Visualization Manager with Clients > The Clients and their Editors > CODESYS WebVisu in the help file for more details.Also I don't think (and anybody feel free to correct me on this) the webserver runs in simulation mode. I think you need to actually run the PLC on the PC "CODSYS Control Win V3" on your PC and download and run the application on that before the webserver is active. Even if you don't have a license CODESYS Control will run for 2 hours before it times out.

Thanks for ur help but I get a strang error When I view the webvisu in http://localhost:8080/webvisu.htmThe error is Baldor.HttpFileResource..ctor() File 'webvisu.htm' does not exist which is in the web browser
