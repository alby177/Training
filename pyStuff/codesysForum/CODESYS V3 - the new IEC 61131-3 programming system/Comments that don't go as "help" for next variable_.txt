Hi, I'm new to this forum and quite new to CoDeSysCode:        // variable name, that changes according to checkbox 1   //i1 : REFERENCE TO BOOL := g_I[1];   // inside "" the name of variable for checkbox1   g_txtI1 : WSTRING := "Checkbox1 name";I don't want for the first two comment likes to go as "help" for g_txtI1.I'm trying to create a template project for simple binary logic testing with HMI.I've created a HMI (8 input checkboxes, 8 "sensors" that can be switched on/off, 8 outputs) + 2 start/stop buttons and i'm trying to make it as easy as possible to set the names shown in HMI for the inputs,sensors and outputs and using wanted variable name in the code (thus the REFERENCE TO BOOL).If I can stop extra comments going to next "help" of variable that would help. Or if someone knows better way for doing a nice template project, I'd like to know?Also I didn't find anyway to set Checkbox's text with variable I created MyCheckbox with checkbox and box where I can change text with variable...
