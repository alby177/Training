Hi Everyone,  Is there a function that could give me DT with MS ex : DT#2016-06-02-06:00:00:200. Thanks

Install the SysTime library.  Open the Library Manager and click on the "Add Library" tab.  In the popup dialog select the SysTime library and add it (Advanced->System->SysLibs-SysTime).  Check out the high resolution function blocks.
