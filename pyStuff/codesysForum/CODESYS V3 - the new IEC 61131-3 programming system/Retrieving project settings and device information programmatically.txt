I have a project with an EtherCAT master, a Modbus TCP master and a Modbus RTU master.We are making automated tests and part of the result should be information regarding the devices and project settings.I've used CmpIECTask to obtain what I need from the task settings, works fine.But how can I obtain the following information programmatically during runtime?Device information (name and version, for example Name=EtherCAT Master and Version=3.5.8.0)Project compiler settingLibrary information (name and version, for example Name=IoStandard and Version=3.5.8.0)I'm aware not all of this will be possible to obtain, but please hint me on how to obtain what I can.Kim HansenBeijer Electronics Automation AB

Hi,I think you should look at the CmpApp library, there is also an example on Store. Look for Applicationmanager in Codesys store.

You can use the CmpApp like so:PROGRAM Version_POUVAR	pApp: POINTER TO APPLICATION;	tResult: POINTER TO RTS_IEC_RESULT;	pAppInfo: POINTER TO APPLICATION_INFO;	strProjectName: STRING(255);	strAuthor: STRING(255);	strVersion: STRING(255);	strDescription: STRING(255);	strProfile: STRING(255);	strLastChanges: STRING;END_VAR// Project Name, Author, Version, Description, Profile, and Last ChangespApp := AppGetFirstApp(pResult := tResult);IF pApp <> 0 THEN   pAppInfo :=AppGetApplicationInfo(pApp, tResult);   strProjectName :=pAppInfo^.pstProjectName^;   strAuthor := pAppInfo^.pstAuthor^;   strVersion:=pAppInfo^.pstVersion^;   strDescription:=pAppInfo^.pstDescription^;   strProfile:=pAppInfo^.pstProfile^;   strLastChanges:=DT_TO_STRING(pAppInfo^.dtLastChanges);  END_IFThis will display the settings show under Project -> Project InformationGetting library version, I'm not sure how to do.

I need the same as you to know about the input outputs of every devices.I have use the iostandard library. There is a function which returns an array of ioconnectors. And every connector has an array of iodevicesparameters. But at the end I can't get the iomaps. I cannot find information about the devices par√†metres.Enviat des del meu Aquaris M5.5 usant Tapatalk

Hi Kim,I could give you two of your wanted Information://Compiler Versionver := __SYSTEM.Constants.CompilerVersion;//Ethercat Master VersionEthercat_Master.m_info.szFirmwareVersion;BREdwin
