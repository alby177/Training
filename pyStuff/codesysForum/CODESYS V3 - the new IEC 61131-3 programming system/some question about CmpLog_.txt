Hi:   when using the logger ， I encountered three problems，who can help me?  1, inside the file of CodeSysSP.cfg，under the component of CmpLog ,"Logger.0.Backend.0.classid = 0x00000104" What does it mean?(0x00000104 --#define ITFID_ISysFile )  2,How can I change the format of the log file？only .csv？  3，How can I  determine the number of log in the file？

I don't think it is a good idea to change this file.It is a file created by the OEM. If you make any incorrect changes, the runtime might not work anymore.
