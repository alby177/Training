Hello everybody! Can you help me? I'd like to launch the EtherCAT bus on the WinV3 RTS via normal Ethernet on my notebook. What i have done for it:0) read documentation 1) downloaded and installed winPcap 2) added entry to the .cfg file - Component.2=SysEthernet3) launched WinV3 (stopped it before)  and i got the log:Code:1315393824: Cmp=CM, Class=1, Error=0, Info=34, pszInfo= CoDeSys Control ready1315393824: Cmp=SysEthernet, Class=4, Error=0, Info=0, pszInfo=**** DrvEtherCat:error retrieving/comparing the MAC address of the adapter!1315393824: Cmp=SysEthernet, Class=4, Error=0, Info=0, pszInfo=**** DrvEtherCat: Did not find Network Adapter with Mac Adr 00:00:00:00:00:00!1315393824: Cmp=IoDrvEtherCAT, Class=1, Error=0, Info=0, pszInfo= Networkadapter could not be opened1315393824: Cmp=IoDrvEtherCAT, Class=1, Error=0, Info=0, pszInfo= Error: Preparation was not successfull1315393825: Cmp=CmpRouter, Class=1, Error=0, Info=1, pszInfo= Setting router <instance>2</instance> address to <address>(0108:0001)</address>EtherCAT Master doesn't see any slave. what have i missed?Thank's

It is advised to use the latest version of CoDeSys (at the moment 3.4.4.0).Make sure your V3 Control Win is running.Double click on your device, scan the network and set your Win PLC as active path.Now go to the EtherCAT adapter and choose the correct MAC ID (it should show at least one).After you have set this correctly you should be able to find them.
