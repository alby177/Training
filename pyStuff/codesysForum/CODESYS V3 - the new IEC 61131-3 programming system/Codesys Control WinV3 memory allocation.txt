Hello,I'm using Codesys V3.5 and Codesys Control WinV3 Version3.5.2.20 and I'm trying to use the SoftPLC provided for free when you download Codesys.I can create an application,downloaded and run it with no problem.The problem is that when I have an application with variables that are declared in a memory location bigger than %MX1279.0 or %MW639 (limit is 1280 bytes or 640 words)e.g. var1 AT %MW641 :WORD; then when I try to download I get an error that "Address %MW641 is out of range(calculated offset:1283, allocated size:1280)Can I configure the Codesys Control WinV3 (SoftPLC) to have a memory allocation bigger than 1280 bytes?Thank you.

Hi,this is a setting in the Control Win device description:<ts:section name="memory-layout">          <ts:setting name="memory-size" type="integer" access="visible">            <ts:value>1280</ts:value>          </ts:setting>          <ts:setting name="input-size" type="integer" access="visible">            <ts:value>1280</ts:value>          </ts:setting>          <ts:setting name="output-size" type="integer" access="visible">            <ts:value>1280</ts:value>          </ts:setting>if needed you could increase it..Edwin

This is a very useful information!Thank you very much!The device.xml at least in my installation is located under C:\ProgramData\Codesys\Devices\4096\0000 0001\3.5.2.10\device.xmlProgramData is a hidden folder.After modifying it I restarted my computer and it had the new change.

Hi,usually the procedure is:1. copy the device.xml (in that case it is Control Win) to another Location2. edit it and save it as ControlWin.devdec.xml (maybe as new version)3. install it into the device repository4. update the device in your project by rightlick in the device tree ->update device to the new edited Versionan restart of CODESYS is not needed...!It is not recommendet to edit in the device repository the devices!CheersEdwin
