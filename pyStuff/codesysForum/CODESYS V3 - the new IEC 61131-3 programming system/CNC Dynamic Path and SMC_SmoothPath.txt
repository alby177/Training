Hi,I have an application which requires functionality similar to the CNC Dynamic Path example provided with the SM tutorials. I have modfied the example to work with a gantry cutter and can now cut a shape using straight lines. However I now need to cut a smooth shape between all the points. I was thinking about using the SMC_Smoothpath FB to achieve this, however this only works on points between G code G51 - G50, but I am not using G code but data written into the interpolator. Is there any way around this, or can somebody suggest a better method,My current code is below:Quote:CASE iState OF 0:	//initialize Queue	QUEUE_RAW.pbyBuffer := ADR(BUF[0]);	SM3_CNC.SMC_SetQueueCapacity(ADR(QUEUE_RAW), SIZEOF(BUF));	iState := iState + 1; 1: 	//fill queue	WHILE NOT QUEUE_RAW.bFull DO					// when the Queue is full, wait until it has been processed by the following FBs		n := n + 1;		GEO.iSourceLine_No := n;			GEO.piStartPos := GEO.piDestPos;		// copy last destination 		GEO.iMoveType := LIN;					// generate linear movement 		GEO.iObjNo := GEO.iObjNo + 1;			// calculate number 		GEO.piDestPos.dX := xp[n];				// generate position 		GEO.piDestPos.dY := yp[n];		SMC_CalcLengthGeo(pg := ADR(GEO));		// calculate length of object with the help of the standard function		SMC_AppendObj(poq:=ADR(QUEUE_RAW), pgi:=ADR(GEO));	//append object to queue 		IF n = SIZEOF(xp)/SIZEOF(xp[1]) THEN	// all target positions processed			QUEUE_RAW.bEndOfList := TRUE;			n := 0;			iState := 2;			EXIT;		END_IF	END_WHILE 2:	//generate 3d path for visulaisation 		pcf(bExecute:=TRUE , 			udiNumberOfPointsInArray:=SIZEOF(pointbuffer)/SIZEOF(pointbuffer[0]) , 			pBuffer:=ADR(pointbuffer) , 			poqCNCpath:= ADR(QUEUE_RAW),			dPrecision:= 10);I assume my path preprocessing would occur between steps 1-2.Any help would be greatly appreciated.
