Hi all,I have read several topics here about how to connect to SQLITE database from CODESYS. The proposed solution was sql4automation which is not exactly what I'm looking for (it's paid and quite expensive). Is there any other solution? Maybe some library?Thank you.

Sorry,  didn't get the right context. This tool is to get access to the SQLlite database with an external tool. Not with CODESYS.

I have several suggestions...1. SQLiteStudio:  (Just google it)  It's free.  2. Python has a library sqlite3 that makes batch processing very easy.3. Devart makes an excel plugin that allows you to connect an excel Spreadsheet to a SQLite DB.  It's reasonably priced.As I recall, the sqlite databases created by Codesys were a little confusing.Hope this helps.John.

Hi, my goal is to connect to sqlite directly from codesys.

Pavol,I actually had the same request and made it to 3S by email.  They basically told me it's not supported or recommended even though they use it internally (Fault storage).I'm assuming they have some stability concerns (i.e. calls to db cause cyclic to be non-deterministic)with end users accessing a database????Regards,John.
