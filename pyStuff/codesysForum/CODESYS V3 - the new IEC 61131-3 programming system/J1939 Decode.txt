I'm working on decoding a few Canbus messages. I know what they do but I don't know what they mean.I have a few IO modules and the controller will send a message of:0x054c00ff 01 a1 20 00 00 00 00 84 -This message will turn on output#10x054c00ff 01 a1 10 06 01 32 00 84 -This message will turn on output#1 with PWM of 50%0x054c00ff a0 a1 60 01 00 80 00 02 -This message will request status and the module will reply with 0x054c0001 a1 a0 00 46 02 00 00 00 Can someone shed some light on what these numbers represent?

I found some new information:If I try to decode the first message I get the following:message priority = 1EDP=0Data Page=1PDU=76 since PDU is less than 240 the next 16 bits are for source and destinationDestination = 0Source = 255PGN=19456Am I on the right track? If so, why is the destination 0? How can I determine what PDU 76 means?Are there PGN messages that I can use to create my own custom hardware?

With J1939 a 29 bit identifier is used.This contains e.g. the Priority, PGN, and Source Address (SA).To filter these from the Identifier you could use something like:SA := _29bitId AND 16#FF;PGN := SHR(_29bitId,8) AND 16#FFFF;PRIO := SHR(_29bitId,24);If you run this with your 29bit identifier (16#054c00ff), you will get as result for the PGN 19456.The other 8 bytes represent the data (SPN) which relates to the PGN.I'm not a J1939 expert, so please correct me if I'm wrong.Anyway I hope this helps.
