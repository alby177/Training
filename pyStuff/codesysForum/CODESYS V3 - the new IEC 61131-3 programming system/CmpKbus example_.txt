Hello,Are there any examples regarding the CmpKbus library? Or at least from where to start?Thank you!

Hi,This is not needed to do manually...Just add the kbus in the configuration (device tree) then download the project and rightclick and scan the devices... add them to your config , download with the new configuration ...map variables etc.I see no reason to use the lib manually in the application maybe i'm wrong.BREdwin

Thank you Edwin for the answer.The idea was, after working with eCockpit, to read the values of the IO modules without declaring the modules on the bus. But i guess that this is hard to implement by a common user.
