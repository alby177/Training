Hi all,I would like to create a connection to an TCP server. I tryed to use CAA NetBaseSrv 3.5.8.10 (NBS.TCP_Client).Code:ServerIP.sAddr := '192.168.5.100';Client(   xEnable:=TRUE ,    xDone=>TCPClient_xDone ,    xBusy=>TCPClient_xBusy ,    xError=> ,    udiTimeOut:=5000 ,    ipAddr:=ServerIP ,    uiPort:=2000 ,    eError=>TCPClient_eError ,    xActive=>TCPClient_xActive ,    hConnection=>TCPClient_hConn );Somehow i get an 'timeout' right away. xActive never gets TRUE. Im sure the TCP server is ready to receive connections.Am i missing something on the device configuration side? I also tryed to add '3S ethernet adaptor' and set the interface (PCI\E1R1). Doesn't seem to help. Controler = Lenze 3200CIf someone could point me to the right direction that would be nice!Kind regards,

Try connecting with putty to the server ip on port 2000 to make sure you can get a connection from your PC. Also make sure that Lenze 3200C supports NBS.TCP_Client/Server and not just the standard SysSocket functions

that timeout is also in microseconds, so 5000 microseconds = 5 milliseconds is a bit too low. Probably increase to 500000 microseconds. If you ping device on your computer and the response takes 10ms, then setup connection for 100ms.
