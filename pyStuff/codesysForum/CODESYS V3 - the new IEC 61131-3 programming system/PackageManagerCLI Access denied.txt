I am having intermittent problems running PackageManagerCLI as part of a Continuous Integration system. I have a pipeline of several jobs running under Jenkins to compile libraries, update and build a project and create a package. Currently the last job in the pipeline is to install the package that has been built before running some tests. It fails intermittently as shown below. Typically if I re-run this build job the command works. Any ideas how to avoid this problem?Quote:"\Program Files (x86)\3S CODESYS\CODESYS\Common\PackageManagerCLI.exe" --verbose --Profile="CODESYS V3.5 SP9 Patch 1"  --install=CODESYS_UniPi.package Package ManagerCopyright c 1994-2015 by 3S-Smart Software Solutions GmbH.

Hi,there is already an issue to solve this in our bug tracker db.CDS-50240 ComponentManager: Improve PlugInCache robustnessThe Workaround is to delete\rename this Cache files in 'C:\ProgramData\AP\PlugInCaches\BREdwin
