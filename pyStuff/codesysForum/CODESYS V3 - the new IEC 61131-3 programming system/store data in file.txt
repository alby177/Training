If you want to log periodically or at specific events then you may want to check the Oscat libraries. The Network library has a set of logging components. DLOG_STORE_FILE_CSV is for logging to file on a filesystem on the PLC itself. An example project is embedded in the lib. Use network lib v1.3.5 for best results. The Oscat forum has additional information.
