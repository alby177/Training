Hi is there some possibility to skip some part in code during compiling code. Based on if with Constant value?Something like this in C#. I've found pragmas in CODESYS, but my idea is that based on constant value will be called certain lines of code.Code:C##if DEBUG    Console.WriteLine("Debug version");#endifPossibility in CODESYS?VAR   diNumber: INT;END_VARVAR CONSTANT   iDebug:INT:=1;END_VAR//in case that iDebug is 2 whole code is skipped in compilation{IF hasvalue(iDebug,1)}(*  the following code is only processed in App1 *){info 'value is 1'}getnumberofadapters(ADR(diNumber));y := 1;{ELSIF hasvalue(iDebug,2)}(*  the following code is only processed in App2 *){info 'value is 2'}y := 2;{ELSE}{info 'value is none'}y := 3;{END_IF}Reason why I'm asking is that in some PLC is unsupported some library and I want to avoid error during download such as unresolved reference to getnumberofadapters
