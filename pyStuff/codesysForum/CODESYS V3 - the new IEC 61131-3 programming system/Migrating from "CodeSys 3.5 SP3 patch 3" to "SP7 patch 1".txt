Greetings. New Codesys 3.5 developer here trying to solve some problems. I work for a comapany so this is not just some leisure project, allthough I'm planning to try Codesys with Raspberry Pi in the future with my personal projects.I encountered a problem when I tried to migrate my existing project made with old CS SP3 path 3 to the newest version. I used the instructions described here: viewtopic.php?f=22&t=5641&p=10083#p10083Reason for the migration is that the new PLC I'm currently testing does not support older versions of Codesys. I get over a hundred errors and all of them seem to point CAA CiA 405 library. Some of the errors read:(Library manager)[ERROR]         caa canopen manager, 3.5.3.0 (caa technical workgroup): Library Manager: Could not open library '#CAA CANopen Stack'. (Reason: The library 'CAA CANopen Stack, 3.5.6.0 (CAA Technical Workgroup)' has not been installed to the system.)(Build)[ERROR]         program_name: Library Manager [Device: Plc Logic: Application]: C0180:  Ambiguous namespace 'CIA405' defined by library 'CAA CiA 405, 3.5.6.0 (CAA Technical Workgroup)'When trying to download the missing library from "Library manager" I only get download failed -message. The fault is not with my firewall bause I managed to download couple of other missing libraries with no problems. Is there a problem with the 3S servers..?

Hi,which plc are you using?this should work, but the question is,if you update to current compiler version and update all devices (by rightlick and update device) then y√≥u should get CANopenStack 3.5.7.0 Version as used library.But sure download the missing 3.5.6.0 Version should work too.BREdwin
