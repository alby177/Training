Dear community,I've checked out the XMAS Tweet store product. With the lib it is possible to use the public twitter api, which is secured by ssl!Within the lib they are using a lib, which is named "WebClientTCP", this lib also includes some new interesting libs, for example "CmpX509Cert", "CmpTls" and "SysSocket2".So now I ask me, if codesys have plans to release this lib with some more examples? I can't have a deeper look into the source code, because the XMAS Tweet app is releases as a compiled library. Maybe someone else know more about it?Thank you in advance

Hello Edwin,thank you so much for this information. This is exactly what I'm looking for. I see a lot of possibilities for these library! So I'm also looking forward to see a update for the MAIL Services library to support SMTPS  . I know that the WebClientTCP Lib is already working . Keep up the good work! So awesome! Best Regards,Kevin

Correction to my last answer: SSL is just supported by some Libraries. Like I do understand the functionality support cames with SysSocket2 Library and some crypto libs. The current Net Base Services Library still doesn't support ssl.BRKevinR
