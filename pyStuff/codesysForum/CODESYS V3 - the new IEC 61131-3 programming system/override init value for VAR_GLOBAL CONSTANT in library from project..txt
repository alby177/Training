Dear community,i'm using VAR_GLOBAL CONSTANTS in an Library to define upper and lowerbound of an array. All VAR_GLOBAL CONSTANTS, have an predefined init value.Now i want to predefine the init value from my Project, where i'm using the Library. I tried to override the VAR_GLOBAL CONSTANTS in the Library from the project, but it doesn't work. Is there any solution or work arround?Thank you in advance!

For libraries, add a library "Parameter list" object (screenshot below).  This will allow you to define a constant that can be changed when the library is used in a project.  The online help should give more information - topic parameter list and then sub-subject GVL.Attachment:lib-props.png

Hello scott,thank you for the fast reply. I added an Parameter list "Param_XY" in the library:Code:VAR_GLOBAL CONSTANT   // Array Param   gc_UpBound : INT := 10;   gc_Length     : INT := 100;      // Timeout Param   gc_TimeOut    :TIME := T#10S;END_VARFB in Library with Array Code: VAR_INPUT   arrTest : ARRAY [0..gc_UpBound] OF STRING(gc_Length);END_VAR PRG in Project:Code:VAR   arrXXX: ARRAY [0..gc_UpBound] OF STRING(gc_Length);END_VARIn the PRG i fill the arrXXX (within the range) and then i call the FB in the library and use the declared arrXXX as Input. This works all fine. But I can't change the CONSTANT Vars in the Paramter List "Param_XY". I tried to add an GVL in the Project:Code:VAR_GLOBAL CONSTANT   // Array Param   {attribute 'const_replaced'}   gc_UpBound : INT := 20;   {attribute 'const_replaced'}   gc_Length     : INT := 200;      // Timeout Param   {attribute 'const_replaced'}   gc_TimeOut    :TIME := T#50S;END_VARbut it doesnt override the paramters in the library and it allways use the parameters from the lib. I can't find anything in the help file about that topic expect the attribute 'const_replaced'.What I'm doing wrong?Thank you in advance.

Everything was good until your last step. Don't define the variable again in your main project. Instead, from your project, open the library object (like you are going to add a library to your project) and then highlight your library and look at the available objects - you will see you "parameters" and you can insert the value you want.
