I have setup a CANopen bus which reads variables from a sensor into my PLC. This appears to function correctly. I have a data acquisition device which is intended to passively "listen" to the CAN bus and record all activity on the bus. I would like to send variables from my project over the CAN bus to be recorded by this device. So far, I can not figure out how to setup CoDeSys to do this without having some sort of slave device with a set node ID. Any thoughts on how I can accomplish this? The CANopen manager does not seem to allow any PDOs to be set within it...
