TIME()it is the time passed since the system startedanswer is in 2.3 as wago has no V3 units yet.some wago do have RTCalso have a look at the oscat library

Wago has the Speedway PLC which can be programmed with V3, but probably you have another type which can be programmed with V2.3. In that case add the library SysLibRtc.lib to you project.In this library is the function to get the real time clock information from the PLC: SysRtcGetTime
