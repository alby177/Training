Hello,On this post I report an issue arised after installation of another version of the CODESYS IDE.On a PC with V3.5SP6 already installed I installed V3.5SP10 to test some newer features. After tests, I uninstalled this version.Then, applications do not build, and IDE report a lot of errors not related to any Object.Neither builds a new application, created following the steps in "Online Help: Quickstart > Create and Run a Project".Just after creation of a new application, the following error is displayed.C0046: Identifier ioConfigConnector not defined.If tried to build, the list of errors increases.Library Manager warns that IoStandard 3.5.10.0 has not been added. <- notice the version number.Reinstallated of CODESYS IDE V3.5SP6, but this did not solve the issue.The issue was solved when I uninstalled CODESYS IDE V3.5SP6, found and deleted any CODESYS related files and Windows Registry entries, and installed again.CODESYS IDE help claims that:>>>Concepts and Base Components > Profile and Plug-ins >>>Please note the following with respect to versions of CODESYS and its components:>>>simultaneous installation of several versions is possible. >>>different versions of the runtime system and the programming system work together .did I misunderstand anything?Thank you
