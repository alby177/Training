Is it possible to change the Color Area limits (Begin of area and End of area) of a bar display programatically?For example, I want to allow the user to enter a set point temperature, which will set a persistent global variable. Then, write a program to change the color area based on the global variable. Processes may have different set points, where below the set point, the Bar Display shows green and above the set point, the Bar Display shows red.Creating a color area and setting the 'Begin of area' value to the setpoint while developing the HMI will make this happen, but I have to hard code the set point into the Bar Display/Color areas/[0]/Begin of area field. The Begin of area field will only take a numerical value (e.g. 50) and not a variable.In general - is it possible to change a property of a tool box item, such as a bar display via the program? I wasn't able to find anything in the online help. Thanks.
