Hello,I want to use Network Variable List(s) for coordinating work between a handful PLCs.I have successfully tested it between 2 PLCs, and am now working on setting up device discovery (so they know they're ready for coordinated work). One part that causes me trouble, is the continued assertion that communications are still running between the PLCs.Before I start on setting up my own watchdog/heartbeat scheme (or some such), I've heard a tale about the NetVarUdp library already having this bit of info.Unfortunately, documentation on these libraries are practically non-exsistant. I've been looking at doing something like this:Code:NetVarUdp.NetVarManager_Udp_FB.NetVarGetConnectStatus_UDP(nBasisId := 0, bConnectNewData => hasNewData);Can anyone speak as to whether this will take me closer to my target?Does anyone know how to obtain 'nBasisId', or maybe what it is?Is there a better way to make sure I have 'live' communication?I am using CoDeSys V3.5 SP7 Patch 2 pbf Thanks in advance-Tobias
