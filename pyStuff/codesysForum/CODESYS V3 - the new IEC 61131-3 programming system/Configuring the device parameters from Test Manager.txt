Hi,I am writing a test script to add a particular device to the project and configure the parameters in the device. The device allows to add new parameters and configure (rename, map variables, set color,...) them. I am able to add the device to the project using python script, but i am not able to configure the parameters defined in the device. Is there a way to configure them using python script?Thanks.

Hi,What exactly is not working when trying to configure the device parameters via the Test Manager?It is possible to read and write device parameters via scripting since V3.5 SP4, but it is not possible to add or remove parameters.HTH,Markus

Hi Markus,I am not able find the script engine calls to add the parameters and map the program variables to the added parameters.Thanks,Mazahar

Hi,Which device is it which allows addition of new parameters?And how do you add those normally - is it in a specific device editor, or another way?As far as I know, there is no generic way to safely add new device parameters - it all depends on specific knowledge of the device which is hardcoded in the corresponding device editor plugin, so the author of the device editor could provide a script interface for adding new parameters.

Hi Markus,Thank you for the response. This device is developed by our in-house development team. Normally the parameters are added from the device editor plug-in. So, i guess having a chat with them may give me a solution.Many Thanks,Mazahar
