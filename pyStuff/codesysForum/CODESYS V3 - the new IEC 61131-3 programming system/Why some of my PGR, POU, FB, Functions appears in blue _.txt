Hi all,i was wondering why some of my PGR, POU, FB and Function appears in blue in my project. I was able to find the meaning for those colors :- Gray : Object is unused (Is also affected by Active Application)- Green / Turquoise : Object is marked as excluded from build (From object Properties -> Build -> Exclude from build)For those colors, I was able to find the information from this threadviewtopic.php?f=1&t=5133&hilit=unused+functionBut i can't find any infos why some objects are marked blueAny ideas ?Regards,Dave

When you make any changes and rebuild your application, the changed POU's are blue.These will be updated with the next online change.

Thank you TimvH,your reply is greatly appreciatedi thought there was something wrong with my code   Regards,Dave
