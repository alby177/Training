Dear 3S Smart Software TeamCan you please make your IDE for Structured Text code case sensitive? (Just ignore the IEC-61131-3 standard).Thank you!Cheers, merry X-Mas!

I would just vote against it!Why moving away from IEC 61131-3 standard?I would rather see every manufacturer moving towards IEC 61131-3 standard so that it would be easier to move ST code between platforms.

I would not want to be that guy standing next to a broken machine, called in on Christmas, only to find out that variable MoveDrive was used instead of moveDrive!A big part of what I like about IEC61131 over C language is lack of small syntax bugs!
