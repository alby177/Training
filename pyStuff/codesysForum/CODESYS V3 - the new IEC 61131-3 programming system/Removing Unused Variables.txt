Hi Being new to Codesys Version 3.5 Patch 8, how do you remove unused variables when using Structured Text.Peter

Run Static Analysis (light). See the help of CODESYS for all the details.

Hi All.Thanks TimvH for your reply.I have been aware of Static Analysis Settings but I don't see the unused variables being shown or listed. May be I should explain what I am doing.    I use Codesys to write individual programs for a specific task then transfer them into the Danfos Plus 1 Programing Environment as a POU.Reasons for this it is much easier to write and test a program in Codesys under Simulation then trying to test it directly in Danfoss Plus 1.I am not sure if others do this, but I would like to know. But debugging a ST POU in Plus1 is time consuming and difficult even with there debugger program.By applying a simulation to the code may produce different results, ie; unused variables. to that of a generated code to a specific PLC type.That I would like to know else I may still be doing something wrong. Being able to remove unused variable during program development in Codesys is much more practicable then in Plus 1 ST Editor.Thanks for your help and looking forward to others suggestions.peter

Actually you should use 'Build --> Generate Code' Option to see the Static Analysis work.
