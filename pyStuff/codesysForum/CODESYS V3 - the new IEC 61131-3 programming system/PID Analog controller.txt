Hi all;I read the related posts on board but it seems to be there is no any subjects related to this.We are building a line follower robot using TURCK's PLC with codesys V3.5sp8.I want to use PID control function block for line follower to minimize the mistakes but I couldnt understand how to commission it.I read analog value from line follower camera between -10V...0V...+10V in PLC like -32767...0...32767And I send this to steering servo analog speed Input directly. (by doing some basic math)I dont know how to commission PID or PD function block on both analog input and analog output.Or maybe I should use another block like Hysteresis?Can anyone give me any advise about it or give me any example about commissioning PID block?Actual = "read_from_line_follower_cam"SET_POINT = ???KP = ???TN = ???Y_OFFSET = ???Y_MIN = 1000Y_MAX = -1000MANUAL = "man_button:=BOOL"RESET = "reset_button:=BOOL"Any help would be great.Thanks in advance

Hi guy,You have to read about PID controllers but imho you should scale input from -32767..32767 to 0..32767.Your analog output has less resolution then input so you can do it in this way.In attachment i am sending example of using PID block.Lukasz
