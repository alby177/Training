Dear Sir,           We have developed a CODESYS project with a TCP SERVER to communicate with a TCP Client running on   another PC. It is working successfully with a Win V3 (soft PLC) device.When it is downloaded to a power PC based  target which is  running a QNX Operating System ,it throws an error which is enclosed.Kindly  help us to resolve this .with regards,Mrs. Praveena

Hi,You need to check the plc log for the unresolved references

Hi!Don't you need an ethernet device?
