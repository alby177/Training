If I have made some FBs in a project and would like to use them in other projects as well - how do I save/export only the FBs? In version 2.3 it was possible to save as ..., but in version 3 its only possible to save project files.

menu Project => Export. Then select the FB's you would like to export. In the other project you can import these again.Better might be to develop a library for your FB's. This is much easier for reuse, but also for managing them.See the help for creating libraries.

I think you need to stand at the top of the project tree otherwise the import will not be placed right in the project.
