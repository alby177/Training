Hi,I am new to using CoDeSys.  I have been trying to get Modbus TCP communications to work with a PM564-R-ETH.  The project itself is managed by ABB Automation Builder.  I think that I have enabled the MBTCP feature as per online videos and instructions that I've found.  Unfortunately, I have yet to figure out how to assign addresses.  According to CoDeSys manuals that I have searched through, mapping a BOOL to a memory address should be as simple as:testbit AT %MX10.2:BOOL;Unfortunately, for every variable with a %MXa.b (a being the byte, and b being the bit) address that I try to create, I get a compile error: invalid address.  It seems unlikely to me that there are zero memory bit addresses available for use when this device claims to work with MBTCP. My guess is that there is some memory byte assignment or configuration step that I have missed.  Any advice is greatly appreciated.Thanks,Warren
