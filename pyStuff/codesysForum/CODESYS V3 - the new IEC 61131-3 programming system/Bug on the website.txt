HelloThere is a bug on the online help:https://help.codesys.com/ms-its:ScriptE ... ngine.htmlIts not possible to see the documentation, codesys support and codesys feedback seems to be ignoring mails because of the new ticketing system.Can a forum moderator please forward this to the support?I wrote emails to codesys more than a week ago and I didnt recieve anything back.Its the opposite of customer friendly if you ignore support mails by default if no ticket from the store is provided... I hope you dont want to force a customer to buy a ticket to tell you about your bugs?
