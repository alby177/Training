Hi everybody,I declare the following enumeration:Code:{attribute 'strict'}TYPE myEnum :(   red, yellow, green);END_TYPEDoes anybode know the exact function of the Strict attribute? And why does this code not compile:Code:PROGRAM myPOUVAR   x:BOOL;   e:myEnum;END_VARe := SEL(x, myEnum.green, myEnum.red);I get this error:C0358:  'SEL(x, myEnum.green, myEnum.red)' is not a valid value for strict ENUM type 'myEnum'When I remove the 'strict' attribute, the code compiles normally.Any ideas? Thanks!

You could try using the instance nameQuote:e := SEL(x, e.green, e.red);

BumpWas does {attribute 'strict'} do and can it be used outisde enums?

See the CODESYS Help:NOTICE!As of CODESYS V3.5 SP7, each enumeration that you add to a project receives the 'strict' attribute automatically in the line above the TYPE declaration. For compiler versions >=3.5.7.0 , this causes compile errors in the following cases:Arithmetic operation with variables of the enumeration typeAssignment of a constant value to a variable of the enumeration type, in which the constant does not correspond to an enumeration valueAssignment of a non-constant value to a variable of the enumeration type, in which the non-constant has another data type than the enumeration typeThe attribute can also be added explicitly or removed.Syntax: {attribute 'strict'}
