Hello !I try to install the latest version of CODESYS V3.5SP5 Patch 1. When I run the file "Setup_CODESYSV35SP5Patch1.exe", I get the error message "Error reading setup initialization file".   So I try to use the file "CODESYS 3.5SP5Patch1 Release.zip" and I get the error message "The compressed folder is invalid or corrupted"    These manipulations were performed on two PCs, one running Windows XP SP3, the other 64-bit Windows Seven.What is wrong ? What do you do ?Thank you in advance for your ideas  

Hello!If you downloaded the files then there is the possibility that both files were corrupted during the download. Happens sometimes.BRMartin

Yes I agree with you, but I loaded 3 times with the same result   And this morning, by chance, a new version CODESYS V3.5 SP5 Patch 2, and with this version no installation problems.   Coincidence, luck or bug fixes   Thank you

I think there is not bug in question, should be some junk or wrong uninstalled copy of codesys before that makes a windows install some missmatch during installation.regards,Alex

Hi JAPIB.Did you start the setup from a network drive? If yes, that could be the reason.If I remember correct, Microsoft made some security adjustments a few years ago. Since then, some installer have problems when executed from a network drive. If you copy the setup to a local drive it works perfectly.BRMartin
