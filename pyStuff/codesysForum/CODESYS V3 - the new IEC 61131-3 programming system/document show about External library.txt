I designed a function in the external library and i wrote some comment as below because i want it can be shown as a Documentation for user. But the comment was shown with no LF(look like document.png). How can i wrap lines as document2.png.//sysTempeBaseAdrsGet//This routine returns the address of the CRG register set of the Tempe chip.//The function returns the correct address only after the Tempe chip has been configured by pciAutoConfig(). FUNCTION_BLOCK sysTempeBaseAdrsGetVAR_INPUT	varIn:DINT;END_VARVAR_OUTPUTEND_VARVAREND_VAR

See online help / Libraries / Guidelines / LibDev Summary / Project documentation ... for possible formatting options.

I copied a sample of title to my library as below//===============// Section Title//===============FUNCTION_BLOCK sysTempeBaseAdrsGetVAR_INPUT	varIn:DINT;END_VARIt is still shown as one line. 

Apparently it is using HTML formatting now. You can try using Code:<P>Paragraph</P> or Code:<BR/>New line

thanks a lot.It works..
