Hi,I'm tryng to read some objects by SDO from a EK1100, I'm using the ETC_CO_SDOREAD without success every time the eError return a timeout, I have tried with different objects found in the xml file without success. The communication with the device works fine I can read and write inputs and outputs.The Codesys version I'm using is the 3.4 sp1 and the target is a RTE 3.4.1Anyone can help me?ThanksDavide

Although I don't know EtherCat or the FB in question (I know CANopen) I would still like to make one remark. If there is an enable input to the FB you may have to keep it enabled until you receive a response otherwise you terminate the SDO READ FB prematurely and the FB aborts. What is the SDO abort message data/code? You should have 8 data bytes from the abort message.

Hi,I keep the xExecute enable till the error message is showedt. You can check the FB status in the attached image.Thanks.

Hi,I'm sorry if someone lost time about this topic, I discovered that the EK1100 doesn't support COE message.
