Hey guys, Does anyknow know if it's possible to load a Codesys project from USB stick. We would like to provide our costumers the possiblity to update there PLC software to the newest version if needed. I know it's possible while using libraries, but then they still need to know how CODESYS V3 works. If you guys have any ideas or walktroughs, it's mostly appreciated!Cheers Qimarox
