Hello.I would like to be able to extract/edit information myself through the *.project file. I have tried to open it in a text editor, but I have some trouble with the encoding of the file. If I set the encoding to be utf-16 I can read some of the file properly, but most of the file is still gibberish. The strange thing is when I use utf-16, then it appears to be xml with utf-16 encoding. This is come of the text I can read:Code:<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?>Can anyone help me with which encoding the file has, or if there might be anything else that I am doing wrong?Regards - Martin Kristjansen
