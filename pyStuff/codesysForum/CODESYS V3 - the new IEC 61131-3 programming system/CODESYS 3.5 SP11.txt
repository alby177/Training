Hi. Some questions about SP11:1. In Features&Improvements I see "File transfer supported in web-visu" and in online help I see "by default, not supported in web-visu". What mean "by default"? Will you release the File Transfer Example in Store?2. Will you release the Visu Elems Library Example in Store?3. When you plan to release Memory Tools Addon?4. I suggest to improve interface variables in VisuDialogs.library with WSTRING instead STRING (similar like CDS-51209).

Hi,attached the example project for tranfering file via Webvisu to the plc and vice versaguess there are some bugfixes in for 3.5SP12you need to add the following config file entry either toCODESYSControl.cfg or maybe better to  CODESYSControl_User.cfg if your system does support this splitted config file Extension.[CmpWebServerHandlerV3] AllowFileTransferServices=1BREdwin

Edwin, can you resave this project in SP11, please?Because common users does not have SP12 until 20.12, I guess.

I've found CODESYSControl.cfg located in C:\ProgramData\CODESYS\CODESYSControlWinV3\D5050FE1. It contained only "[SysFile]". After adding the entry you suggested I still get Error Code 7 on Web Visu. Did I edit the right config file?
