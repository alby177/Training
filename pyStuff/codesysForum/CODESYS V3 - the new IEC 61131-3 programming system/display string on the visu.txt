hi i am trying to Display a string of size 255 char. but the HMI Screen is size only 150 char . the remaining 105 char i am not able to see.my question is how to get that in the new line , so that my string data is displayed completly

use Ctrl + Enter

hi,thanks for the reply but  i want to Display the string in other way as Show below examplestring1:= string(255) , other string in PLC  moves  values to string1 ( PLC code) now i want to Display string1 on to the HMI . by using rectangle element . this as to Show all the text automatically in to second line without entering ctrl+enter

Try this:string1:='FirstLine$RSecondLine';

HiThanks for the reply.This is working with $r or $n .Sadly I am not allowed to  change code in the plc to insert $N or $R:I had contacted codesys for the same ... They informed me that ,they had rectified this problem  in v3.5 SP 9. I am  going to update my codesys  SP on my system.and update you on it ....
