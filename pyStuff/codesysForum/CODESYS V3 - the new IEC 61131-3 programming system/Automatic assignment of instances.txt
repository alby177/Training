Device|-Drive	|       ^---Type1|       ^---Type2|       ^---Type3|       ^---Type4||-IO|     ^---Type1|     ^---Type2Hi,I have the product line as mentioned above. I have 4 types of drive devices and 2 types of IO devices.Please note that the number of each device may vary as per my PLC configuration.I wish to declare in my program a global variable as below:VAR    device : Array [1..MAX_NO_OF_DEVICE] of Device ;END_VARIs it possible that I can assign an individual type of device to the indexed element.For e.g. device[1] is (Drive > Type1)device[2] is (Drive > Type4)device[3] is (Drive > Type3)device[4] is (IO > Type2)device[5] is (IO> Type1)Regards,Rahul.

no impossible as a declaration is not dynamic.however you can compile it with a variable in the compile list.

Yes this is very possible indeed using the new OOP features in V3:Create a interface called IDevice and add a method Update to that interface (and the other methods you'd need ) and then create a few function blocks implementing the interface and the interface methods.Code:FUNCTION_BLOCK FB_Drive1 IMPLEMENTS IDeviceMETHOD UpdateQuote:VAR_GLOBAL	Drive1: FB_Drive1;	Drive2: FB_Drive2; 	IO1: FB_IO1;		Devices: ARRAY[0..9] OF IDevice;END_VARCode:Devices[0]:= Drive1;Devices[1]:= Drive2;Devices[2]:= IO1;FOR I:= 0 TO 2 DO   Devices[0].Update();END_FOR
