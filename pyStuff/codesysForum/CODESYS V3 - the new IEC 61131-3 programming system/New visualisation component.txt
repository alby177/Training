Hi!I'd like to know is possible to make new custom visualisation component? If yes, is there some documentation about how we can do that?BR,Mladen

Hi,Currently, this is only possible using the "Visu Element Toolkit", which can ordered via the 3S sales department.We're thinking about other ways of making this available, but no decisions were made yet.HTH,Markus

Hi,The Visu Element Toolkit usually comes with training and support. As I am not an expert in this area, I did point our support department to this thread, and they responed they're already in contact with you.HTH,Markus

i got another problem now:if i try to check visual elements, even in the 3s example lib, i got the following error message:

There may be attribute error on your libary. Or There may be version dismatch with your project , your codesys version  and visu element toolkit version. Check them please.So what is your codesys version ?what is your visu element toolkit version ?what is your project libary version ?

Update your libary to  3.5 sp4. if there is dismatch in your libary project, Codesys should ask you for update after open your libary project.

Good morning,I am trying to learn more about the Visu Element Toolkit myself.  What kind of possibilities does it offer for designing new items?Thank you,Doug

Then you can set variable to your special component from your codesys project.For example;You develop a special gauge component. (The gauge have three arrows , Each arrow will show different data ). You can do it.
