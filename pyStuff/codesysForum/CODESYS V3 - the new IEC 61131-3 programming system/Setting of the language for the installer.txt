Hi,I want to call the CoDeSys V3 installer from my own installer. But I also want to select the language for the installation. With CoDeSys V2 I used parameter /L0007 to select German language and all forked fine, but not with CoDeSys V3. I tried also with /L1031 - the same result. Which parameter on the command line I have to use to select the language?

Hi, below some information from the support of 3S-Software which I got some time ago:********************You have to use the unpacked setup to use a response file for automation.It does not work with the self-extracting setup.Follow these steps to create a silent setup: 1. Recording a response fileSimply run your setup with the Setup.exe /r command line parameter. => all your setup choices will be recorded in Setup.iss. The file is placed in the Windows folder.2. Copy setup.iss to the Setup folder 3. Deinstalling setup4. Testing setup: Start setup with the Setup.exe /s command line parameter************************Maybe you can try this with the option "German" as installation Language.
