I'm using SoMachine, which runs Codesys V3. I'm using a Schneider M258 connected to 3 Leeson SM2 drives via CANopen.I have imported the EDS, but now I'm not sure what to do. Read through the SM2 manuals on CANopen, but still can't come up with a way to talk to it.What I'm trying to do is tell the drive to start/stop and set a speed.I'm pretty sure I need to use the SDO_WRITE function block to write to some SDO's, but not sure how I would send the values.Hopefully someone has some insight on this because I've been searching for days and can't come up with a solutionthanks!

Hi,use CAA CIA405 library:Snippet:Declare	ciaSDOWrite4 : CiA405.SDO_WRITE4;	usiNetwork    : USINT         := 1;		  // NetId = 0 <=> Network = NetId + 1 = 1	xEnable       : BOOL;	udiTimeout    : UDINT         := 0;	Device        : CIA405.DEVICE := 1;       // Addressed device								              // range 0 â€¦ 127								              // 0 means local device 	wIndex        : WORD          := 16#1020;	bySubIndex    : BYTE          := 16#02;	aData	      : ARRAY[0..3] OF BYTE := [16#11,16#22,16#33,16#44];	usiDataLength  : USINT := 4;	xLastEnable   : BOOL;Code:(*This example code writes a 4 byte object with a SDO Write Expedited Transfer*)ciaSDOWrite4(	NETWORK:= usiNetwork, 	ENABLE:= xEnable, 	TIMEOUT:= udiTimeout, 	DEVICE:= Device, 	CHANNEL:= 1, 	INDEX:= wIndex, 	SUBINDEX:= bySubIndex, 	DATA:= aData, 	DATALENGTH:= usiDataLength, );IF ciaSDOWrite4.CONFIRM THEN	xEnable := FALSE;	ciaSDOWrite4(Enable := xEnable);ELSIF ciaSDOWrite4.ERROR <> CiA405.CANOPEN_KERNEL_ERROR.CANOPEN_KERNEL_NO_ERROR THEN	//Error occured	xEnable := FALSE;	ciaSDOWrite4(Enable := xEnable);END_IFxLastEnable := xEnable;hope this snippet is useful...BREdwin
