Hi Everyone,I'm currently loosing my mind with the flag and specially with SFCInitI've tried a lot of things but nothing seems to work :SSo I'm using SFC(Chemical) like a function block, and I'd like to go back to the init step when I press the reset buttonSo what I've tried:VAR_INPUT SFCInit:BOOL; END_VARIn my SFC POUbut when I'm trying to call it in another POUI used: PLC_MAIN.Chemical.SFCInit and I received the error message: C0037 Chemical is no Input of PLC_MAINI tried too by selecting SFC Init (USE and Delcare one by one and the both) but nothing to do is not workingBut when my program is running, in my SFC chemical, I see the flag SFCInit and If I force it, my SFC is reseted (like it has to do)I've tried too the same thing than in the help of codesys 3, so declaring it as a global variable:VAR_GLOBALSFCinit:Bool;END_VARbut it's not working :/So if someone has an idea of what I could do Many thanks in advance

Hi freedumz,I think you set the SFCInit not in a proper way.Since you Chemical POU is a function block you have to instantiate it:PROGRAM PLC_PRGVAR      ch1 : Chemical;      bDoInit : BOOL:END_VARAnd now you set SFCInit frow outside using an instancech1.SFCInit := bDoInit;ch1();That should workRegards,Roman
