Has anyone had success with running version 3 on a 64bit windows 7 platform?  If so, how did you get it to work?

This is not supported yet, but it works perfect in the Virtual Windows XP mode of Windows 7 (also on 64 bits systems).

V3.4 SP2 with 64bit support is available for download 14.12.2010

Is it only about the programming system or does the rte V3.4 SP2 work on windows7 64Bit as well? Because I can't get the service started.

This is correct. The Control RTE doesn't work yet on 64 bits systems.This is scheduled for earliest 2012.

Hi Team,Is there any further update on having the bug fixed?Thanks,

In my opinion you can not call this a bug.It would be a bug if 3S-Smart Software Solutions would have created a 64bit Runtime, but it doesn't work.Now it is a missing feature, which is under development.

Got it...The end result is that it does not work   Good news is that it runs ok in virtual mode

Does it run on windows 10 64bit?

Hi,the download here:http://store.codesys.com/systeme/codesy ... te-sl.htmldoes contain a 32Bit Windows- and 64Bit Windows Version of Control RTE and will run on Windows 10 too.BREdwin

I only need to use the CodeSYS OPC server on windows 10 64bit. Does it have this in the RTE version?
