Unfortunately, I can't seem to resolve this issue I know how to change shown screen to other using control's configuration like button click event.However, I couldn't find the way to change current visualization with other using CODESYS library function.Are there any functions I can change shown screen such like ChangeScreen() or ShowScreen(), and so on?Thank you in advance.Chris,
