Hi AllTrying out the Package Designer..I would like to put in my entire Project, the libraries, Device desc, Visu styles, Visualization together into the project. But i have some issues understanding a few things :- adding the libray profile, where do i find in my project what library profile needs to be added to the Package ( is it Library Manager --> Placholders --> Resolved by libraryprofile, Resolved by visualization profile ..).- what libraries need be added to tha package, does it include the libraries added by the User, Visu specific libraries, device libraries, everything in the Library Manager.Should the referenced libraries be also added to the package designer.I tried out opening the Oscat Network Package..but couldn't deduce too much. Any help would be greatly appreciated.Thanks.
