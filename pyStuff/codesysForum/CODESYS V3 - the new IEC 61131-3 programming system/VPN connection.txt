Good evening,I am trying to connect to a device through a VPN connection in order to download future applications. I have done the VPN connection succesfully and I can see my device using programs such VNC viewer but when I want to connect CoDeSys, I do not detect the device scanning the network.Should I make any kind of change on the communication settings of CoDeSys or my VPN?Thanks in advance

Hi,one option is to add the Gateway of the plc (use the IP Address of the VPN/remote machine) then a plc scan should be possible.second option: use the TCP Blockdriver by adding the device'add device' then use the VPN/remote IP address and select in 'Assignment mode'  -> 'IP Address using TCP',both options should work.E.Schwellinger

I did several trials and reached to the first option. Anyway I did not know that there was a second possibility. Thanks a lot for your help!
