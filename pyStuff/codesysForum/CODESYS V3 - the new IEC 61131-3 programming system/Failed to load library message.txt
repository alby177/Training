HelloSo, this morning, this error appeared from no where.Everything working ok for weeks.Does anyone have a suggestion?Thank you

Hi There - was curious if you had found out anything on your question?  If something like this happens, I normally do a "Clean All" followed by a "Rebuild".

HiThanks for the suggestion. No luck though. Paul

Hi,either update device on the plc device to have everything in current version or dowload missing libraries in LibraryManager should fix it.(and check if current comiler and visuprofile is set)BREdwin
