I am writing a Data Logger application to run using CoDeSys Win SL. Is there a chance that you could direct me to examples of CSV creation, reading and writing routines using CoDeSys?Thanks

Thanks TimvH,The File-Utilities example did help a lot, but now I do not seem to find the right source of information to properly structure the CoDeSys expression that allows "linking" strings separated by commas. I have unsuccessfully attempted different variations to the Pascal expression:      String_Chain := String_1 + ' , ' + String_2 + ' , ' + String_3;where all the variables are declared as strings.Any additional suggestion will be appreciated.

You can use the function CONCAT for this:String_Chain := CONCAT(String1, ',');

Thanks again TimvH,I believe that will work.

Can someone please send me a sample code for implementing read/write/open/close .txt or .csv or .bin files. I tried implementing it, but could not read the .txt and .csv files at all.

See the help files they have good example..pic attached

Does this work for variables of all datatypes or just Strings? I tried doing it with REAL datatypes, read and write works fine, but I cannot see the data when I open the text file (.txt). Is there a work around?

Actually the file created is a stream of ASCII chars. You could convert the real to string and write.

learnetkThank you. I really appreciate your prompt response. I tested it out and works great.
