I am a CodeSys Device User,programming with CodeSys V2.3 or CodeSys V3.5. When I try to download the newest CodeSys V2.3 or CodeSys V3.5 IDE, it is restricted to registered users.      But how to becoe a registered user? and where to login as a registered user?

For registering go to:http://www.codesys.com/download/passwortanforderung.htmlFor downloading go to:http://www.codesys.com/download/download-center.htmlJust select one of the items you want to download. When you are not logged-in yet, you will see a dialog where you can click on to enter your name / password.

Maybe you want to try it on another PC or with another browser.

Hi.Do you use a Javascript blocker? If yes, that could be reason. The login dialog is shown after clicking on a download link.BRMartin
