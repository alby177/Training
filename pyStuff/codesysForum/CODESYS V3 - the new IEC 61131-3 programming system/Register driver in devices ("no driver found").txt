Im writing a IO Driver for Codesys which is supposed to support EtherCAT devices. In my device description I have the following line:Code:<Connector moduleType="40100" interface="Common.Ethercat" role="parent" explicit="false" connectorId="2" hostpath="1">Which allows me to add EtherCAT devices to my IO Driver.But when I run this Program I get an error on each Device which states "No driver found" (stays the same error wether in stop or in running mode).I think my problem lies within the regestration of the driver in each device.Can someone tell me how to correctly register a driver instance in different devices?here is an image showing the structure of my project and the resulting error message:
