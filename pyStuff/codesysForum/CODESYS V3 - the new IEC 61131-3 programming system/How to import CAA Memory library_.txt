Hello,I think the CAA Memory library was originally imported to my library repository along with a project which I downloaded from the forum. It can be found in Library Repository:Test Versions(not recommended)->Intern->CAA->Utilities->CAA Memory.However, I cannot find it by using "Add library" in "Library Manager".Can someone help me?Thanks!

When you add the library, click Advanced.Then go to the section "Use Cases".Here you can select the library "Memory".

However, in both cases, I cannot find the CAA Memory library. All the libraries under "Use Cases" are from 3S - Smart Software Solution GmbH.
