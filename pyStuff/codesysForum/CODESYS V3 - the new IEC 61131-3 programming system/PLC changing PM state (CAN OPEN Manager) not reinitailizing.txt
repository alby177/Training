Using the ignition to toggle the states between ON,OFF,Low Power,Sleep.   I am trying to configure a Wachendorff A3 to enter low power for 60 seconds after ignition is off.   After 60 seconds the unit completely shutsdown.   The unit enters the low power state which keeps the application running preventing the screen to reboot which takes 30 seconds.   I have two CAN open nodes that shutdown when the ignition is off.   When the ignition is turned back on with in the 60 seconds the screen wakes up the visu starts up and the CAN nodes send their boot message.  The problem is that the CAN manager will not restart the nodes.   The stay in pre-op.   How can I sent my application(CAN manager) to restart the slaves when there bootup message is sent.
