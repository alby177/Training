Hi! We have some recommendation from 3S and I found viewtopic.php?f=11&t=6111&p=11855&hilit=webserver#p11855, but I still having some questions about work with Library download. We need create our own library download server. I configured the https:// Web server on my PC in company's local network. The directory structure is similar to the one in the library repository. My question just about additional a „index“ file. What file extension I need for „index“? (I tried all files (*.*) but it doesn't work)And where I can find more information about features of Library download and how we can use it effectively in our work?

I set my own https:// web-server but with CODESYS Library Download it doesn't works. I use Apache 2.2, set Log Level debug.When I connected to server from browser in log i see that connected is successful, but it is not connection by CODESYS. In both case the handshake is done.Browsers log: [Fri Oct 28 09:43:20 2016] [debug] ssl_engine_kernel.c(1870): OpenSSL: Handshake: done[Fri Oct 28 09:42:29 2016] [info] Connection: Client IP: 127.0.0.1, Protocol: TLSv1, Cipher: AES128-SHA (128/128 bits)[Fri Oct 28 09:42:29 2016] [debug] ssl_engine_io.c(1882): OpenSSL: read 5/5 bytes from BIO#4bee50 [mem: 23533b8] (BIO dump follows)...IDEs log[Fri Oct 28 09:43:20 2016] [debug] ssl_engine_kernel.c(1870): OpenSSL: Handshake: done[Fri Oct 28 09:43:20 2016] [info] Connection: Client IP: 127.0.0.1, Protocol: TLSv1, Cipher: AES256-SHA (256/256 bits)[Fri Oct 28 09:43:20 2016] [debug] ssl_engine_io.c(1893): OpenSSL: I/O error, 5 bytes expected to read on BIO#4bee50 [mem: 23533b8][Fri Oct 28 09:43:20 2016] [info] [client 127.0.0.1] (70014)End of file found: SSL input filter read failed.[Fri Oct 28 09:43:20 2016] [debug] ssl_engine_kernel.c(1884): OpenSSL: Write: SSL negotiation finished successfully[Fri Oct 28 09:43:20 2016] [info] [client 127.0.0.1] Connection closed to child 63 with standard shutdown (server owenlib.local:443)Does it problem in CODESYS Library Download or SSL certificate?I will be grateful if you can help me.
