There is no device Tab. The devices are part of your project tree.

under window there is a thing called reset all windows, now i do have a devices window, however it is empty yet.

View -> Devices.Might be opened in a new window, try to drag it over the usual location, where you can "dock" it, and will appear as a tab, beside the POUs.

Problem is solvedI used reset windows, then the tab was empty, but after restart new it is visible and showing the devices.using ALT+2 was not showing the window. (maybe hidden, do not know.)
