THis is my first week Programming PLC's and i'm working through the First Steps with CoDeSys.It all seems to go fine until i try to Build the Project, which brings me up multiply errors with the same code,Error 4024: PLC_PRG (4): Expecting ":" before "2" as an example.Now im using the latest software and the instructions are Dated 2004.I imagine the software has been updated numerous times since the instrutions where last updated.  Could this be where its all going wrong?Any help would be much appreciated.Gary

I am not quite sure which section you are getting the error on ("First Steps..."), but my first guess is you missed the ":" in an assignment statement ("x := 2;", not "x = 2;").  Also, possibly to missed a ";" at the end of a previous line.  Goto the line of the code the compiler is complaining about and look at that line and a few previous to it.  If you are using CFC, then maybe a wire is not actually terminating at an input/output on a function block.

Cheers ScottThis is my first attempt at writing a program, following First Steps.......Following this guide, i get to the last step prior to creating a visualization, which is called BUILD PROJECT using the F11 key and that brings me up the 3 errors.I have copied & pasted my lines of code.PROGRAM PLC_PRGVAR	Trig1: R_TRIG;	Trig 2: F_TRIG;	Timer 1: TOF;	Timer 2: TON;END_VARWhat is CFC?As for my timers,I Have nothing connected to the ET outputs on both my timers.And the 2 PT inputs are addressed as T#5s but have remained PINK.  Is that normal?Thanks for your help

Hi,your declaration is not IEC compliant. Whitespaces are not allowedWrong:garybolton2014 wrote:PROGRAM PLC_PRGVAR	Trig1: R_TRIG;	Trig 2: F_TRIG;	Timer 1: TOF;	Timer 2: TON;END_VARCorrect:Code:VAR   Trig1: R_TRIG;   Trig_2: F_TRIG;   Timer_1: TOF;   Timer_2: TON;END_VAR

Thanks SingletonI'll re-write and see how it goes
