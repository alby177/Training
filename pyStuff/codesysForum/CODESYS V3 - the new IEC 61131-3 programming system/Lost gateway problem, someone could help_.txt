It seems your gateway is OK, but the PLC cannot be found.Which PLC do you use? If it is the SoftPLC (WIN/RTE) then I just think it has stopped and you have to restart it again.In the System Tray (next to the Windows Clock in your task bar) you can find the icons on which you can click to restart it again.

Thanks to TimvH.I use the softPLC (Control Win V3), PLC and gateway are still running,the gateway logo will resume colorful after stop and start the Gateway and softPLC,but when I login,the problem happen again.

The same problem at my PLC,I'm using Vendor specific RTE, so when I login eg. 10-15 times, the connection breaks and gateway losts (No cennection to the device. Please restart the gateway). I have to restart whole PC (windows XP embedded). I think this is global problem of 3S Gateway.regards,Alex

Hi,suggest to send a projectarchive to 3S Supportwe should reproduce this, then we could help on this issue.cuEdwin

I think it maybe the bugs of Ver3.4.4 ,after I used Ver3.5.0, the program never happen again.
