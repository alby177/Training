Hi all,I have been running CoDeSys 3.5.8 in a 32 bit Windows 7 Pro Virtual Machine (Windows 8.1 Host) for over a month without problems.  Suddenly, yesterday when I start CoDeSys it is taking forever to load.  Looking at task manager I see my CPU usage is pegged at 100% shortly after the program starts up and pretty much stays there.I tried upping the memory allocated to the VM but that didn't help.  I have free space in the VM's hard drive. I didin't make any other changes to my system.Has anyone every experienced this?[Edit] I noticed at the bottom of the CoDeSys screen it says "Searching dependencies"Thanks.

Hi,if you are working in simulation this is a known bug,if you have the chance to update to 3.5SP10 Version this will be solved.BREdwin

I'm using the Eaton version and the latest they have on download 3.5.8 Bugfix 2.  Is there a way, maybe with a startup switch, to force CoDeSys to start out of simulation mode or to reset it so that it will start.I have installed another copy on my host system but just wondering if it would be possible to get the other one back up running?Thanks,nOrM
