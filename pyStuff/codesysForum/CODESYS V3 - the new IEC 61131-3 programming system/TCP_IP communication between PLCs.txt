Hello all,For a project i need several PLCs (codesys 3.5) communicating with each other. We like to do that with TCP/IP.We have to transfer structs with information. The structs contain arrays and normal variables.The CAA Net Base Services looks the perfect library.I downloaded the example program in the Codesys store. Every thing runs fine on a local soft PLC.But when i make a project in the controller it self, the library gives a lot of errors.When i choose "try to reload library" i'll get a pop up that the library is  not installed om the system.Does this mean that this library is not installed for this type of PLC? Is the TCP/IP communication always availible on every type / brand of PLC in code sys 3.5?regards Patrick

Hi,maybe this FAQ should explain why this could happen:viewtopic.php?f=22&t=5641&p=10085#p10085Looking forward for 3.5SP5 to have a really good solution for this.Which plc and which version of it are you using (the placeholders in the devicedescription are responsible for the library versions)?BREdwin
