Hello,I have made a CAN based CoDeSys V3 Project with Visualizations and external graphics. Instead of running on a PLC, I use CoDeSys Control Win V3 to run the project on a Laptop. Ideally, I'd like the end user to receive a flash drive or equivalent with some sort of executable file on it such as a .exe or .bat that simulates what the project does in "Run" mode. I know I can lock out functions with permissions, or create project archives that extract themselves... but both of those methods require a CoDesys 3.5 Installation, and I'd like to avoid that if possible. In my opinion, that would limit portability and require the end user to have some technical knowledge, where as many people know how to simply load a program off of a flash drive.Is there some sort of 'release mode' I can choose after compiling? Can I somehow boot load the project onto the end user's laptop? Is there an emulator that can support such functions? Another idea, if CoDeSys can output C or C++ code, I can compile it myself and release it. I am open to any and all suggestions. Thank you,  Vadim

Hi,sure this is possible but not without installing Control Win on customers pc.There is a standalone setup for Control Win available. (This you get on request )I would recommend to give this to your customer.First you need to integrate your bootapplication and adapt your CODESYSControl.cfg file into the Setup (let's say customize the setup with your files)For adding your application you need to copy the Application.app and Application.crc to the Setup.Give you more details on how to add the files to the setup soon.We need fist to generate an 'unacked' setup Version for this. This is an open Point,please let me know if you need this.BREdwin

Edwin,I'd love as much detail as possible for the whole process. I have been playing with it for the past few days but have made no progress. I think this information could be helpful to other users as well, to offer a complete solution for the original question.Thank you,  Vadim

Hi,you need an 'unpacked' standalone setup for Control Win (this will be available on Version 3.5.7.20)then you add to this Setup your customized files to  \CustomerFiles\CoDeSys\CopyFiles\GatewayPLCin your case: Application.app, Application.crc and CODESYSControl.cfgyour CODESYSControl.cfg should have the Peak USB Can Driver component and in the section CmpApp you should set the Application Name[ComponentManager]Component.1=CmpTargetVisuStubComponent.2=CmpCodeMeterComponent.3=CmpWebServerComponent.4=CmpWebServerHandlerV3Component.5=CmpPCANBasicDrv[CmpApp]..Application.1=Application..After installing this on your customer pc you have a ready to use Control Win with your application.Your customer Need to start the plc by rightlick into the tasktray 'start plc'If the customer need an 'autostart' of the plcon each Windows Startup ->  he/you need to set the Windows service startype 'CODESYS Control Win V3' to automaticBREdwin
