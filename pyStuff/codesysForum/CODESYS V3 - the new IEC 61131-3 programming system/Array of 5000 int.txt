Good day,I created in FunctionBlock array [5000,10] of int.  When i connect to PLC, in on-line mode i see only int between [0,0] to [100,10]. Why? It is very big dimensions for array?

It could be an visualization questionIn monitor, try to visualize a[500,5]

Thanks you, in program i saw a[500,5], but in identification variable zone maximum [100,10].May be in some parameters in View of CoDeSys possible chande this paramater of maximum showing case of array.

Hi,You need to rightclick when you are online in the declaration part of the editor.Here you could set how many varibles you want to see in the online view.BREdwin

When i double click on the array one dimmensions, open dialog "Monitoing range"but when i double left click on the array double dimmensions, not open this dialog
