I got this error today when i added Image switcher into visualization:[ERROR]         Unable to query the effective value of enumeration value VisuEnumElementBehaviour.VERTICAL[ERROR]         Unable to query the effective value of enumeration value VisuEnumElementBehaviour.VERTICAL[ERROR]         Unable to query the effective value of enumeration value VisuEnumElementBehaviour.VERTICALOn other visu's I also use img switchers, everything ok.Image is .png which is supported by target. I cannot get off this error, can't even explain it???Most interesting is that every time i visit visu, when edit, number of errors incerment, now i have it like 259...regards, Alex

I figured but it is painful...If i place and configure image-switcher is OK, but if i resize it i got 200 Errors, bug or something I dont know. Then I have to delete and place it again.That fame works very slow...looks like the .png pic (120*80,65kb) is to heavy for VISU_TASK, or not.Anyone have the same experience?
