In my systems , there is the requirement of accessing the variables of the IEC application to display in a HMI.Do you have any examples?Best regards

Here is a table that will help you.  You have to use the AT keyword to locate the variables to IEC address.  Then the HMI reads the IEC address via Modbus registers.Here are some examples how to use the AT keywordmyBool  AT %MX0.0 : BOOL; //Boolean TypemyInput AT %IX0.0 : BOOL;myOut   AT %QX0.0 : BOOL;myByte  AT %MB0   : BYTE; //Byte TypemySINT  AT %MB0   : SINT;myUSINT AT %MB0   : USINT;myByteArary AT %MB0 : ARRAY[0..10] OF BYTE; myWORD  AT %MW0   : WORD; //16 bit typesmyINT   AT %MW0   : INT;myUINT  AT %MW0   : UINT;myWordArary AT %MW0 : ARRAY[0..10] OF WORD; myDWORD AT %MD0   : DWORD; //32bit TypesmyDINT  AT %MD0   : DINT;myUDINT AT %MD0   : UDINT;myReal  AT %MD0   : REAL;myDwordArray AT %MD0 : ARRAY[0..10] OF DWORD;mySTRING AT %MB0 : STRING;  //STRING  Jzhvymetal

This is only valid for some devices. The device should in this case have Modbus Slave capabilities.In general the easiest solution would be to use the CoDeSys HMI.Choose an HMI which can run the CoDeSys HMI (could also be an industrial PC with e.g. Windows XP embedded) and create your visualization in your CoDeSys application.If you have an HMI which doesn't run the CoDeSys Visualisation, but has its own tool, it would be best to choose one which has a specific CoDeSys driver.In this case you can directly access the CoDeSys PLC variables.In this case you need to add the Symbol Configuration to your application and select which variables can be accessed by the HMI.If your HMI is a PC, you could also choose to use a SCADA package and access the variables (available through the Symbol Configuration) with the CoDeSys OPC server. All SCADA packages have an OPC client and therefore it works quite easily.I hope this helps you find the right solution.

In this case you can directly access the CoDeSys PLC variables.In this case you need to add the Symbol Configuration to your application and select which variables can be accessed by the HMI.====================================================How to diectly access the CoDeSys PLC variables without a protocol such as CANOpen or J1939? How to access via Symbol Configurationï¼Ÿ

This depends on the PLC you use.Normally you should be able to use the programming port (USB/Serial/Ethernet).In your CoDeSys V3 application you can right click on the application and add the object: Symbol Configuration.Here you should add the variables.Please contact your PLC vendor and HMI vendor for further details.

Thans!Now,i can access the iec variable by the name!In codesys ,i used the Symbol configuration to define variables which i need accessed outside of codesys.Also,i used the templates in CoDeSysRTK to access the predefine variables .i do it successed!
