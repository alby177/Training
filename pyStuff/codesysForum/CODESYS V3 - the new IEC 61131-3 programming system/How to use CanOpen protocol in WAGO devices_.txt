Hi All,First af all, I am completely new about Wago and Canopen communication protocol.I have Wago 762-2035 touch panel (Canmaster) and a Stoeber motor driver with Canopen option card (Slave). Wago software version: 2.3.9.35. I already install driver's .eds file in the correct place of Wago Software.How can I make a program for reach/get some information (speed, working time, current, vs.) on the driver in real time?Or could you please send me an example program about communication between Codesys and any mark Motor Driver?Thanks in advance.

Add the CAN master to your PLC in the PLC configuration.Then add your drive to the CAN master.In the properties of your drive you can see which variables are read/written.CODESYS will automatically create input and output adresses for this.

Dear Mr TimvH,Do you have an example for this subject? Thank you.

An example should be able to be found on internet.My first google search gave me the following link:http://www.wago.com/wagoweb_china/publi ... 00_0en.pdfIn chapter 4 is some information which could be helpfull.If you don't understand this, please contact your supplier or Wago for a training.

Thank you for your helping. MR. TimvH.
