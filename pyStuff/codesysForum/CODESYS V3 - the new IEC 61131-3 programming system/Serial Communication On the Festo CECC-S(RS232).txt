I would like to read some data from a serial barcode scanner using the CECC-S, on the RS232 serial ports. I am however Struggling to access the RX and TX pins in the codeysys software. The only info  i receive from the help function is the libraries that i shoulld use. Could anyone please be of assistance if you have knowlegde on how to solve the problem.-

This is actually quite simple:The system library SysCom23 is the one to use.It includes the following POU's to do the communication.SysComSettings - the settings are introduced to the block as a specific structSysComOpen - opens the port SysComRead - reads from the RX pinSysComWrite - writes to the TX pinSysComClose - Closes the port The most simple way is to make a sequence that first introduces the settings, then opens the port, writes or reads and closes the port.There is no need for special HW-configuration. The first RS232 on the left is COM1 and the right one is COM2 as default.The easiest way to test the COM-port is to make a direct connection from COM1 TX to COM2 RX.
