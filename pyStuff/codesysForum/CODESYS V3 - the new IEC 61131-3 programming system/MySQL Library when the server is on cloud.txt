Hi everybodyIn 'MySQL' or 'MsSQL' libraries the database target must be an IP address + port. when your database is located on a cloud it seems to be different (on the cloud side..): you are authorizing specific IP holder to access from within the cloud DB instant see: https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql ... ppaccessIPmy question is: Is there a way to work this out? Will appreciate any reply..Joseph Livne

As far as I can see they talk about the IP Address which is connecting to the cloud. You need to give them the permissions to connect.Your client still connects to the cloud via IP Address.

Hi,if you will setup correctly IP address of PLC, gateway and DNS PLC running on CODESYS V3.5 is able to resolve hostname given by your cloud provider such as Google, Amazon or Microsoft Azure.IP address for this authorization is your outsider IP before WAN.This library has function for resolving hostname to ip addresss.https://store.codesys.com/mssql-library.html

Thank you Scheapper and Tomas. I think this solve the matter for me now.  

Hello J_Livne,The MySQL library also resolves the domain name. You can use the Domain address or the IP-address on "sHost" Input (MySQL_Open FB).It autodetects the address type, if Hostname is detected it automatically resolves the address. Please let me know if you need further information. BR,KevinR
