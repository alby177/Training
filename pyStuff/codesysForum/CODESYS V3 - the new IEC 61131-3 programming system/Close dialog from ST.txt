Hlelo,I am calling an ST script from a Visualization. Is there any way to close the current Dialog Visualization that a certain condition?Something like:Code:(OnDialogClosed method:)IF DataResult = OK THEN// Close DialogELSE// Don't close dialogErrorFlag := TRUE;END_IF

Hello,maybe this example application would help:https://store.codesys.com/visu-dialog-st.htmlRegardsplcmax

Also there should be a simple way to do it with Visu Utils library, but unfortunately there is no example in Store.

Hi,check the third application (Version 1.0.0.3) in the device tree of this example... BREdwin

Thanks, Edwin - i'm not thinking that it will be update this way.But I need to say that VisuUtils not only about dialogs (also transfer files, iterate clients) - so I suggest to create individual example.
