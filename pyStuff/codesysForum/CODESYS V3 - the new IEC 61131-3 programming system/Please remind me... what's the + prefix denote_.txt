I'm using the AP SDK to develop CoDeSys plugins, and there's a convention to use a + prefix, but I can't remember what it means.I have an example TestObject class lib, and a +TestObject class lib.Does it denote an interface library?Thanks in advance--R

The documentation of the AP gives the following information:The "+"-sign in front of the name has the purpose of clearly identifying the project as an interface component at first glance.  It is recommended that this convention is followed.

Of course. Thanks.Found it in the pdf.
