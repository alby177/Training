Hello all,Is there any instruction that tells the system is in simulation mode?I'm thinking on a pragma to avoid adding code into the PLC but at the same time getting the desired result...Anyone knows about this?Thank you!

Hi,you could use:__SYSTEM.Constants.bSimulationModeBREdwin

Perfect!This combined with the pragma "hasvalue" will do it, thank you!
