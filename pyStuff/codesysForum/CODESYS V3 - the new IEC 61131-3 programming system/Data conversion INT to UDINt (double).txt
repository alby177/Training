Hello,I'm a n00b to Codesys programming, so sorry in advance if my question is a bit stupid   This is probably not a dedicated V3-question, but since I'm working in V3.5 SP10 I guess I should post my question here anyway?!I work with a Seeeduino CAN-Bus shield mounted on Arduino (sender) and a Opus A3 Display (receiver). Im sending INT values of max value of 65365 (2 bytes) with CAN to the display. Like an example: Im sending INT x =12345 to the display and give it to a global variable global_x(INT) and show it on the display. This works. But now I want to convert this integer to a double. I think in CodeSys you need to use UDINT? Because I want to display 123,45 (12345/100). I tried to give the value of global_x to a local variable (UDINT) and divide by 100. But this is not working when I want to show it on my display.Maybe someone has a clue? Or is there a way to convert an INT to a UDINT (double) in Codesys when you declare a local variable?? Or do I have to give UDINT to my global_x also ?With kind regards,beamster

The function you are looking for is INT_TO_UDINT.Another way to visualize the value 123,45 from an integer is to set, as text variable displayed, the code Code:INT_TO_REAL(yourVariable)/100The conversion to REAL is required in order to "enable" the decimal values.
