hi, allSystem HWï¼š1.IPC+win7 Ultramate2.CODESYS V3.5 SP33.EtherCAT Master + 1 ABB Servo Driver4.Modbus TCP Master + 1 AC500(ABB Product)Problem:EtherCAT device might disconnect after running 2~3 hours, the red triangle appear on the left side of the EtherCAT device.Any of experience shared from you would be appreciated. br/listenyang

hi,either there is really a disconnect Problem by Hardware (wiring) or somehow, the Driver does not manage to send and receice ethercat frames, which CODESYS Ethernet Driver are you using eepro 1000 or realtek?cu

this seems to be the problem,what exactly you mean with 'it need update the Driver the Adapter again' you mean you have to reinstall the Windows driver?- I thought this is a Control RTE System (with SoftMotion)?Never seen that....cu
