Hi all,I use Cia405.NMT:Code:CIA405_NMT_INST (NETWORK := NetId + 1, ENABLE := CIA405_NMT_enable, TIMEOUT := 1, DEVICE := device, STATE := Cia405.TRANSITION_STATE.RESET_NODE);And sometimes I get the error Cia405.CANOPEN_KERNEL_ERROR.CANOPEN_WRONG_PARAMETER.Does anybody know the conditions for a CANOPEN_WRONG_PARAMETER error?Regards,Edwin.(In the project, I re-used software from CoDeSys runtime V3.4.3.* and CoDeSys GUI V3.5.0.*. Which was functional.Now I use CoDeSys runtime V3.5.2.* and CoDeSys GUI V3.5.2.*.)

Hi Edwin,Some weeks ago I was at a customer who had the same message when using the RECV_EMCY function block.If I can remember correctly it was related to the fact that the device was either not configured correctly in the device configuration, or the communication was not working correctly yet.Is your CAN node communicating correctly with the CODESYS controller?

Thank you, for the reply.The CANopen slave is communicating with the CoDeSys CANopen master successfully.I'll investigate the configuration. And try to isolate the issue.Regards,Edwin.

I have errors when calling this function block like this:NMT(NETWORK:=1,ENABLE:=TRUE,TIMEOUT:=1,DEVICE:=0,STATE:=Cia405.TRANSITION_STATE.START_REMOTE_NODE)CANOPEN_REQUEST_ERROR.

yue_qi_qi's CANOPEN_REQUEST_ERROR topic is here: http://forum.codesys.com/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=5224

The new release of CoDeSys V3 wil support up to 10 CAN busses (where CiA405.NMT is functional), my OEM reports.
