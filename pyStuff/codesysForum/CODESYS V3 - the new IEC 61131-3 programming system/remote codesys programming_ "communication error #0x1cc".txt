Hi,I'm programming Codesys with remote gateway (public IP address on WWW and 1217 port open on fritzbox router).I can to ping this ip address. No problem with "scan network" on Codesys: I see "green led" on my gateway and Codesys found Raspberry Pi.But, When I download new firmware on Raspberry Pi, I see this messagge error:"Communication error: #0x1cc"Why ?

Hi,yes sure,If you use the 'update tool' - the Debian package of the new version is copied via ssh to the Pi (this ssh Connection is independet from the CODESYS communication because we need it to deploy the runtime even if there is no CODESYS plc running on an fresh installed sd Image)after that it stops the runtime on the PI install the new Version and start the new runtime. (Gateway is a component of the plc runtime, therefore it stops too)This is independent from the CODESYS Login communication (as I told works by ssh) so if you are logged in by CODESYS while you execute the update,the communication to CODESYS will be interrupted because of the restart of the plc runtime.So a new scan of the runtime or Login even without scan by CODESYS will reconnect/establish the communication between the CODESYS development system and the plc runtime again.Hope this Information understand what happens here.BREdwin
