Hi EveryoneI made a Function Block that would be part of a Library. The user of this library could use as many instances of the said function block which is not known at the time of implementation of the Function Block / Library.Is it possible to dynamically create an Id for each instance of the function block that the User creates. Does anyone have an idea how this could be done.Thanks and regards

What is wrong with letting the user define the name when the user uses your FB?Code:PROGRAM ExampleVAR   Inst1 : YourLibrary.YourFB;   Inst2 : YourLibrary.YourFB;   Inst3 : YourLibrary.YourFB;END_VAR

Hi Scott Probably i couldnt explain my issue.So i try it again, inside the function block i have a variable which is the Id of the function block, just as shown belowFunction_Block Motorvar Motor_id : uint;end_varso if the User of the library has an two Instances of the function block like fbMotor1 : Motor;fbMotor2 : Motor;then i would like the Motor_Id in fbMotor1 to have 1 and Motor_Id in fbMotor2 is 2, or any other number.Thanks and warm regards.

Use VAR_STAT to define an internal FB var that is static across FB instances.  Then add an Fb_INIT method (see the help) that will increment the counter and assign to a var output.Code:FUNCTION_BLOCK MotorVAR_OUTPUT   MotorId : UINT;END_VARVAR_STAT   InstanceCount : UINT;END_VARMETHOD Fb_Init : BOOLVAR_INPUT   bInitRetains : BOOL; // if TRUE, the retain variables are initialized (warm start / cold start)   bInCopyCode : BOOL;  // if TRUE, the instance afterwards gets moved into the copy code (online change)END_VARTHIS^.InstanceCount := THIS^.InstanceCount + 1;THIS^.MotorId := THIS^.InstanceCount ;
