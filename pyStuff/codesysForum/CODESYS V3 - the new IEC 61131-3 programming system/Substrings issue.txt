Hi, I'm using codesys v 3.5 SP7 with Berghof IEC 2250. I connect to Wonderware Archestra platform via IO-Codesys Core Server / ARTI3 protocole. I have a problem with managing strings. I recive a package of information in one string, separated with specific symbols ex. information!information@information...information. I can find the places for symbols with Standard.Find, and the length with Len function, but how to extract the information beetwen symbols? I would like to copy it to different strings and converts to integers.Any ideas? Thanks!

I've solved the problem with the most simplified functions like LEFT, MID and RIGHT and FIND ofc. There were only few offset issues. Pls close the topic.
