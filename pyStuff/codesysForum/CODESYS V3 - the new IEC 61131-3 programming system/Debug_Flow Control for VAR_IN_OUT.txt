Hello,does anyone else have some issues with Debug/Flow control and variables declared as VAR_IN_OUT (at least in FBD view and LD view) ?Declaration as follows:FUNCTION_BLOCK TestFBVAR_INPUT	Input1,Input2:BOOL;END_VARVAR_OUTPUT	Output1:BOOL;	Output2:BOOL;END_VARVAR	DelayON,DelayOFF:TON;END_VARVAR_IN_OUT	IO_StartBit: BOOL;END_VARIn FBD view, it seems that the processed statements / variables are correctly displayed in a green Flow Control boxes, while the value of the variables itself remain ??? (Example in FBD_logic.png). Attachment:FBD_Logic.PNGIn LD view the same logic displays the Flow Control boxes in a network up tu the VAR_IN_OUT variable as green and then they become gray, while the inside of the status of the VAR_IN_OUT variable is green (Example in LD_logic.png). Attachment:LD_Logic.PNG  All this goes against the description of how Flow Control in the help files...or maybe I'm missing something ? (This does not depend on the actual value of the VAR_IN_OUT variable.)The logical operations itself seem to be preformed correctly, just the Flow Control display seems wrong to say the least.
