Hi everyone I met 2problens with codesys v3The first is concerning my alarm history If I've 3 sane alarms which occurred only the last one will be registered in the history file (I see it with a visualization) The archive in alarm is activated but I don't know that I've to put as a subdirectory)(any idea?) Now I'm not able to connect my laptop to my plc I've the following error : you're using inconsistent Unicode settings, please check your compiler defines for the current application)(-> VISU_USEWSTRING)  and your settings for the visualization I insert visu_usewstring in my compiler but nothing has changed   (I found the solution for this part restart the computer) Many thanks in advance for your help
