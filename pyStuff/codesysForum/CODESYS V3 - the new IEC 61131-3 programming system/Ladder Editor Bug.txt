I am writing another article, "Four Ladder Rungs - How something so simple can be so useful?" which I hope to publish in Control Engineering magazine.  The idea is to show a simple state machine technique that can be used on virtually any PLC platform.  Included in the article is a download of the example project and a link to one of you OEM customers website where readers may obtain the IDE.        I have encountered problems with the LD editor not being able to open POUs with a string of compare functions like the following:Attachment:CodesysBug.JPGI can enter, compile and run the code just fine as shown below.  But when I close the project and open it again the POU containing this code will not open.   If a copy of the POU is made the copy will open and a momentary message is displayed complaining about not being able to represent something or other. It doesn't stay up log enough to make a screen grab or to read it fully.  The copy will not open the next time the project is opened either.Attachment:CodesysBug (online).JPGI could of course work around this by adding more rungs but that pretty much destroys the premise of the article.  I really would like to showcase codesys and your oem customer's IDE in the article so any advice or information about this bug would be greatly appreciated.  I have attached a project that contains the above offending code.  I should also note that this bug had managed to completely hose an entire project.  It's something people who do a lot of ladder would be upset about.Thanks for your attentionRick[edit]I have since recreated the corrupted project which is also attached.  When opening the project I get the following message box:Attachment:CorruptedProject.JPG[edit]And here another project (PlcStateMachinePrograming-0004) using GE,LE, NE with an AND block (FB MSMLD128) where POU does not open.  MSMLD64  also does not open.Attachment:CodesysBug (AND function).JPGI am using Bedrock 1.3a IDEAttachment:Version.JPG

Hi Rick,your CorruptedProject.project ist just a file with nothing but 151 649 zeroes. How did that happen?RegardsRoman

Just making edits with the ladder editor, saving and opening the project.  Ladder POUs that won't open can be opened by either copying them or cut/paste them back into the project.  But after a number of iterations the project sometimes gets corrupted.
