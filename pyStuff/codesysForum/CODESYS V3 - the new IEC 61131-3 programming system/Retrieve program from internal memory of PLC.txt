Hello,I'm working with a Schneider PLC: TM218LDA24DRN. So Machine 3.1 (Codesys 3.1) is used for programming.I would like to know whether it is possible to retrieve the PLC program from internal memory (or memory card, in case of other models).For example: Let's say, I've been tasked to modify an application that is controlled by a Schneider PLC. I don't have the program on hand. Instead of recreating the program or writing one from scratch, I would like to retrieve/ import the program from PLC memory to So Machine 3.1, modify the program, and download to PLC.Is something like this possible?Thank you.
