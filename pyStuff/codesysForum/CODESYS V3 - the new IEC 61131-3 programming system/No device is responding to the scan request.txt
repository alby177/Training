Hi,which plc is this...?maybe the bootproject is corrupt and lead to an crash on the startup of the runtimeBREdwin

It is a xc202 from eaton MoellerIt's the second time in one week that I've a plc which has this problem

Are you on the same network segment? You can get problems when you are on a switched network. For example the default broadcast addresses for network variables don't work in ours.If you haven't tried that then try it without a switch.Sent from my SM-G935F using Tapatalk

I have a similar problem with c300 from Lenze. But the problem was an bug that i made in the code.The problem was that we write our program on c300, and everytime it srarts has rhe same problem.Watching log and erasing our program from cfcard solves the problem.Responds a ping but not able to connect.
