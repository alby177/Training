Hello, another question from a Codesys newbie, is a possible way to convert an integer value to a byte array,for example i try to make a program that the user will insert a value such 567 and i want to convert it to 4 bytesThank you in advance 

An INT is only 2 Bytes Long.  There are several ways to achieve this.One is to create a union with an INT and an array of BYTESCode:TYPE TwoByte : UNION   i: INT;   bytes: ARRAY [0..2] OF BYTE;   END_UNIONEND_TYPEIf you create a variable:Code:MyVar: TwoByte;Then you can copy the integer into Code:MyVar.iThen the two bytes that make up that integer will be available at:Code:MyVar.bytes[0]MyVar.bytes[1]

Thank you very much for your reply, if I write this code I receive an error about UNION, is it a codesys code?

Actually in older Codesys you Need to activate the Proffesinal Feature to find Union.
