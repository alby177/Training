Hi I am new to CODESYS and Wago PFC200. I downloaded CODESYS 3.5.8 and PFC200 package manager. I also updated PFC200 package manager.I want to create *.CSV files including: date, time and some scaled values from I/O modules. I want PFC200 to create *.CSV files and save them to a specific folder in my computer automatically.I did this before with SIEMENS TIA PORTAL S7-1200. My *.CSV files were automatically created on the CPU's web server and I downloaded them automatically from web server with windows task scheduler. I don't know how it is done in CODESYS. Do I have to use a specific library? I know how it is work with SD RAM; but after commissioning I don't have access to PFC200 or SD RAM; so I need to save them on web server. Thanks in advance
