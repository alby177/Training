I'm quite confused with CoDeSys versions.So what does “SP” mean in "CoDeSys SP Win V3",why now becomes "CoDeSys Control Win V3"?

It is just a name change. In my opinion a good choice, because Control is much clearer than SP.In the detailed information, when you install the newer CoDeSys version, you should have read this.

Good,   So what does “SP” indeed mean in “CoDeSys SP Win V3”?

"SP" was the abbreviation for SoftPLC. But as Tim already wrote: "Control" shows it clearly, that the runtime system is meant to control a machine process etc.
