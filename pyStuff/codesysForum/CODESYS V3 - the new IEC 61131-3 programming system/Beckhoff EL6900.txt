Hello,I'm starting in using Beckhoff safety controller EL6900. I downloaded the safety package V4.0.0.0 (demo version) from Codesys store web site and installed on my machine. Then I dowloaded from the Beckhoff web site the device descriotion for EL1904 and EL2904 sefaty modules.When trying to import them in the device repository I get the alarm:"The safeguard description file for device 'EL1904' ... could not be generated due to error #21'.The device description imported is:ELx9xx.xmlThen, I'm not able to link the virtual modules to the physical modules.Does anybody have some suggestions?Thanks a lot in advance.
