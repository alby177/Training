Hi allI am operating remote systems that are controlled by our Codesys applicationrunning on PLCâ€™s with the WindowsCE operating system.The application has a web visualization and there are buttons in the application that open file dialogs for loading or saving files to disk.Now and then I need to upload to, or download files (recipes, log files, etc.) from these PLCs to my local PC and I would prefer to do that via the browser, is there a way to do that?At the time being, we use the following workaround:Connect WindowsCE to a shared folder in the local network (at the remote site)copy files from and to this shared folder via some secure connectionreturn to the browser and open a file dialog to load or save the file from this shared folder.
