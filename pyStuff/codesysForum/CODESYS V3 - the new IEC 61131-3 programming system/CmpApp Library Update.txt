I know this is a CODESYS specific forum, but I can't find any helpful information anywhere else.I am working with an older version of Schneider Electric SoMachine software (version 3.3.10.1 M218). We purchased source code files for one of our production cells. Before opening, I made sure that I had the same version of the software that the vendor had. However, when I open the project I am confronted with a library version error that I cannot figure a way around.The issue is with the version of the CmpApp library being too old in my version of the software. I currently had version 3.3.1.10 and the program requires version 3.3.1.40. I do not have the required library installed on my machine and I am not sure where to download it from. I do however have a newer library version installed, but cannot seem to override the call for the old version. Help with locating a download for the library or with overriding the version call would be much appreciated.
