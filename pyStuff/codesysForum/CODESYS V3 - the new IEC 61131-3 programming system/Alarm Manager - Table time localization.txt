Greetings,Is there a function or setting that sets the Alarm Managers Visualization Time to local time?  I am certain it is rather simple, just cannot seem to put my eyes on it currently.PLC/Linux time is UTC, we adjust that time on power up to local time zone.  PLC_PRG()1)	Values set in first cycle (Always called once after power cycle)        setTZInfo : DTU.RTCLK.TIME_ZONE_INFO;  // adjust time from the system time . 2)	Called if time is not initialized (usually called once after power cycle)                fb_SetTimeZoneInfo  		: DTU.SetTimeZoneInformation;	                fb_GetCurrDateAndTimeInit	: DTU.GetDateAndTime;		       xSystemTimeDateInit    – assign value (time and date) returned from fb_GetCurrDateAndTimeInit 	        soft_clock			: RTC; 	- Assign xSystemTimeDateInit to RTC.PDT Notice I never came back to SetDateAndTime() because I don't want to alter the real-time clock.  I wish it to remain UTC time.Kind regards,Doug Rilee
