HelloWith all versions of CODESYS V3 we found an option called "Features" (Tools -> Options -> Features), where we could choose Standard, Professional, or specific settings, to see or to acces more or less objects, libraries ...With SP7 version I can't find such option. Is it a bug or a normal thing ?Thank for your answer  

Hi,this has been removed. Everything is now professional feature set now.It was really a pain. There are so many examples standard user could not add Imagepool,netvar list etc... hard to expain why.This difference is not really needed so it have been removed.BREdwin

Thank you Edwin.It is a good idea to remove this option.It was not so easy to know what option was selected.Best regard.
