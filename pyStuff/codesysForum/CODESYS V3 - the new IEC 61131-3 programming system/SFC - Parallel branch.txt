Im using a parallel branch that the program pass thru many times. There are some jumps that return to few steps before of the parallel branch.The normal condition the steps _100_Exec_1 and Step241 get active (blue color) and wait the GVL.bExecTabeDone after a others steps the program can jump to the step above of the paralllel branch... working fine.But in some conditions the alternative GVL.xPause_PLS set to True and the program do another routine. So, when the program return with other jump to the steps before the parallel branch, just the step of the left column get activate. Then, when the GVL.bExecTableDone goes to TRUE again the SFC stay stopped as the picture below.Attachment:sfc.jpgAny idea?BR
