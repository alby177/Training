I'm seeing an issue where the step entry action (as opposed to IEC action) is not executed for a step immediately entered after the init step. Other entry actions work as expected.This has to be a bug.

The problem is that the IEC "N" Action on the Init step was executing and over-writing what happened in the entry action of the subsequent step.Bug in my code I guess, but CODESYS actions can be confusing as all hell!

Agree that they can be quite confusing.Another thing I noticed is that if you have a transition with a regular boolean variable and you reset this variable with IEC-action "R" in a later step you wont be able to get past that transition even tho the reset comes after the transistion.

A good reason to avoid them IMHO
