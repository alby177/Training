Hello,I'm trying to use the DirRemove function from the CAA File library to remove a directory with files inside on SoMachine.I saw there is an input who makes it possible : xRecursive.Normally, if you write this input on TRUE, you can remove a directory with sub-directories and files inside. But when I test it, I receive an error WRONG_PARAMETER.I tried too with xRecursive on FALSE and I got an error ERROR_UNKNOWN. If think it's normal because you can only remove a empty directory (that's what I understand...).So if you have a solution to use this function or if you have another one to advise me because I'm a little bit blocked... Thx for your help !
