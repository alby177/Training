Hello everyoneWe have installed the SVN PlugIn. In out project, we use a Library, which is also connected to SVN.Actual we try to create a library function, which reads the SVN-revisions of the project and of the Library itself, and writes them to outputs. Normally we would read the VERSION in the SVN_VERSION_INFO constants.If we read the SVN_VERSION_INFO.VERSION constant in the library, we are able to compile the library. But if we try use the library code in out project the error:  <<C0046: Identifier 'SVN_VERSION_INFO' not defined>> occurs.If we read the SVN_VERSION_INFO.VERSION constant in the project, everything works and we get the SVN-revision of the project. (But we also need the revision of the library and it would be great if both is done by a library function)If we use the SVN_Info_Summary.sVersionSummary constant instead of the SVN_VERSION_INFO.VERSION constant in the library, we are able to compile the library. But if we use the code in our project the error: <<C0136: ambiguous use of name 'SVN_Info_Summary'>> occurs.If we read the SVN_Info_Summary.sVersionSummary constant in the project, the same error occurs.What is the best way, to get the SVN-revision of the project and the SVN-revision of the library itselt, inside a library function?Thanks
