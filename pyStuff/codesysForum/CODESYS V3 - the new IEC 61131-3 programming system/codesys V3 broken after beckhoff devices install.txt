I have added all the device xml descriptions from beckhoff website to device library as mentioned inviewtopic.php?t=7366#p16495https://www.beckhoff.com/english.asp?do ... lconfg.htmIt seems this has totally broken my codesys dev environment. I cannot even create a standard project, codesys hangs forever and I need to kill it. If I remove the device directory in C:\ProgramData\CODESYS\Devices, I can create a blank project, or at least it doesn't hang.I am trying to repair my codesys install. Is there a way I can fix the device library without having to reinstall all my devices by hand ?
