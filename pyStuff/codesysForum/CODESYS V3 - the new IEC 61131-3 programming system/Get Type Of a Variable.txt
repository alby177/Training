Hi all,Is it possible to get the type of a variable during runtime?Something like : typeof in C# ?Thank you.

Code://DeclarationVAR   MyVarInfo: __SYSTEM.VAR_INFO;   MyTestVar: INT;END_VAR//CodeMyVarInfo:= __VARINFO(MyTestVar);//after this line of code MyVarInfo contains all information obout this variable - just watch in online mode and you will understandBRRalph

Thanks, it works fine!But how can someone get some info about these special functions?I cannot find anything about it in the help.Thank you.

Hi Ralph,Thanks for the tip. This is very useful!Tim

Meaning if you pass a structure to _VARINFO how can you get info about it members?

If internals variables are exported to symbolic comunication, I am thinking that you want is posible via cmpiecvaracces.But i have not found information about that library.I have could see information, using cmpiecvaraccesd, of program variables but not about fb members
