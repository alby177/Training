Hello,I'm a beginner with Codesys and i hope someone can guide me in the right direction.I want a program to run once a day at a specific time. E.g. at midnight a sequence will execute on the PLC.The sequence that is activated will either be a SFC or a ST Case statement.I have tried to google how I can use TOD to trigger this, but I am not really sure how to use it.Can someone maybe guide me in the right direction.Thank you.

Check your system libraries for retrieving the current hour. Check for when the hour rolls over. The function call to get the system clock can vary depending on your hardware platform. You may need to check your hardware system libraries.
