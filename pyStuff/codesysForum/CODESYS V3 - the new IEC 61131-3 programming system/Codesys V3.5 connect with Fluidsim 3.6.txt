In the V2.3 execution I'm able to connect Codesys with Fluidsim 3.6 from festo.But it have to be possible with 3.5 too.The problem is that de varibles are not visible in Fluidsim.I have created the Global variable for the in and outputs.Created a new PLC in the gateway,  this PLC is visible in Fluidsim but not the variables.I think it somewhere in codesys have to be changed that it will sent the variables, or that windows/firewall is blocking this. I have search several things but nothing works.For my own development I wat to have this connection working so I can created hydraulic or pneumatic schema and control it with a PLCDoes someone understand the problem and what could be the answer.
