Hi,I use Codesys V3.5 SP8 Patch 2.With trace recorder I write a file in .csv with the values of two variables and then use it in Excel.Field Trigger.Date writes the date/time in a format that I cannot turn with Excel.For example, today Trigger.Data; 147557616 This number should indicate today date and time (04/10/2016).How can I decode this number?Thanks to all.
