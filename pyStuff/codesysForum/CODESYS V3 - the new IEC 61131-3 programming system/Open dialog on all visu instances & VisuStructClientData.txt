Hello,I have two (very specific) questions about the hidden IDialogManager interface and VisuStructClientData struct.What I would like to do is open a dialog on the target visu when someone has clicked somewhere in the webvisu. I know how to open a dialog using the IDialogManager, but it requires a (single) pointer to VisuStructClientData. Is there a way to launch the dialog on all clients? (not optimal, but could live with it)Or maybe a way to get the clients list? (better since I can search for the client of type targetvisu)As a bonus, knowing what is inside VisuStructClientData would be very helpful.Thanks!
