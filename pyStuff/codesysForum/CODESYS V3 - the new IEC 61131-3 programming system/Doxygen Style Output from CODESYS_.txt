Hi folks,We currently use Doxygen to document our C and C++ source code which generates some nice HTML files that we can then reference as a part of our design specification, this means that if the API changes then the design specification will still be pointing at the latest generated Doxygen documentation and therefore doesn't need to be changed, saving a lot of work, magic!I was wondering if anyone knew of a way to do this with CODESYS in terms of documenting libraries, obviously Doxygen is not up to the task but CODESYS does a nice job of creating documentation from the comments that are placed in the library source code and these can be seen in the library manager - what I was wondering is, is there a way to export this auto-generated documentation as a html file or something similar, even a plain text file would do.Thanks in advance.Pete.
