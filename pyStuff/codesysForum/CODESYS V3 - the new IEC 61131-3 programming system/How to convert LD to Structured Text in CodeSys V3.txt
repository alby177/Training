Hi, In CodeSys version 2.3 there was possibility to convert LD pou to Structured Text. Is this posibility too in version 3 of CodeSys (I can not find this option)?regards Marcys

Hi Marcys,there is definitely no such functionality in CODESYS V3.I'm wondering how did you manage to make this in CoDeSys V2.3?Regards,Roman

Hi,oh sorry, I should write how to convert from ST to LD/FBD in CodeSys v3In CodeSys v2 you click right mouse button on PLC_PRG in ST a choose Convert Object, then you chose new name and destination format IL, FBD, LD and CodeSys v2 will convert it. I have attached screenshotAttachment:CodeSys2_img1.jpgAttachment:CodeSys2_img2.jpgregards,Marcys

Hi Marcys,the conversion ST to LD/FBD is not present in V3.Regards,Roman
