Hi..I have created project and downloaded to Hitachi HX Cp1h16  PLC. Its running and I have logged into it.Now my question is that I want to access CPU from another PC for monitoring purpose using same project.Now if I login from another PC then it does not allow.How to do this ?

If you can connect to the PLC from the computer 1, then it looks like that the problem resides on the computer 2...Firewall issue? (given you are using Ethernet)Bad Ethernet port? (given you are using Ethernet)Software not installed correctly?Just to clarify any doubt about it, you can't log in at the same time from two computers.Does any of those assumptions help you?
