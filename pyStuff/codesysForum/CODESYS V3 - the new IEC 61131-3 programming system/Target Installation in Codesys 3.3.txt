Hello,

How to install Target device file in codesys 3.3? I target file is available with me.

At first you have to be sure that you have format of your target-file like this plc.devdesc.xml
Start up your CoDeSys V3 and go to the Tools->Device Repository->Install and choose your file. Your device will appear  in PLCs branch of Device Repository.
After that you can add your devi√±e in project.

How can I define new target? I have some old open frame PLC on 8051 platform programmed with C, but I'm not familiar with C. How can I change compiler?

The CoDeSys Suite consists of the IDE (development environment) and Runtime system.This Runtime system needs to be implemented on your device.This is done in cooperation with 3S-Smart Software Solutions.I think you should contact them directly to get a price for your hardware (CPU + OS) and the amount of runtime licenses you need.If it is only for one application I think you should look for devices which already have this Runtime implemented.

We have only one machine with this PLC, so buying some licenses is too expensive (I think). Have you any idea of price for basic functionality (w/o HMI and buses)?We must change some functions and add 2 operations. Because don't have original documentation, we download program from MCU and decompile, but this version is without comments. Very difficult for us to find parts/modules in program what we need. I make many PLC applications before, and for me is easier to write new program, then I analyze old C/ASM code.

I think it is better to buy a new PLC and replace the current controller.

Thanks!!!
