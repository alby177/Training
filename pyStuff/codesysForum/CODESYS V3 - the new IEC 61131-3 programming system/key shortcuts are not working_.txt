Hello all,I'm using TwinCAT 3, so probably it will have some small differences, but the environment should be more or less the same... so I've thought on asking here...Using TwinCAT 2 I was able to press F6 to switch from the declaration area to the programming area in any window.Using TwinCAT 3 I can see the F6 is assigned to Window.NextSplitPane which seems to be what I would like to get, but pressing F6 does not make anything...Thank you all for your answers!

This will be TwinCat specific. You will have to ask them or look for customizing your system keys under options. The platform I use which is based on CoDeSys 3.5 still has F6 functioning like you describe

OK, thank you for answering!

I was able to add some shortcuts in the Visual Studio options.Write Values (Ctrl + F7) and Foce Values (F7).
