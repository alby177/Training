Sent this to the the support email but I thought I was going to give the community a shot at it as well and maybe speed up the process.I want to know how I can access specific PDO data by code WITHOUT the need of mapping a variable to the EtherCAT I/O mapping. The reason for this is that since our users will be copy/pasting the objects when they multiply axes, I want to keep the required adjustments to a minimum.1. Let's say we have this slave drive and motor object.2. The slave drive has this PDO defined. In my case I'm interested in the Digital Inputs value read from16#60FD.3. Now, I know that normally you would simply use the EtherCAT I/O Mapping tab and map a variable to the Digital Inputs, but this is exactly what I'm trying to avoid.4. If I monitor Servo1, I can see that the data I want is actually available in Servo1.in.dwDigitalInputs which seems to update correctly. However, this structure is a local variable and can't be accessed from code, only from within the watch window.5. How can I access the data I need using either the motor object or its parent slave object (the L7NH drive)?Please note that reading the data with extra SDO:s isn't an option. It's already transfered by the cyclic PDO and *should* be available somehow Any help appreciated, I'm really stuck on this one...Kim HansenBeijer Electronics Automation AB

Hi,you can access through IoConfig_Globals:Code:IoConfig_Globals.<YourDriveName>.<Paramter>
