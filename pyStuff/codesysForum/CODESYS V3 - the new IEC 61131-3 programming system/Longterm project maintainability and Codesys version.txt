Let's say we have a project developed with Codesys 3.5.3. Let's also assume we don't have a project archive, but we do have all the auxiliary files created by the compiler and  we can login to the Runtime platform without problem.Now a couple of years later a software engineer with a newer (clean) installation of codesys 3.5.7 wants to connect to this platform without making any modifications or downloads, but just needs to login and check some variable values, observe if the logic is working properly etc. What would he need to do, in order to do so without changing the platform with the runtime nor the project files ? Should he just use the older Codesys 3.5.3 installation and install only the 3.5.3 libraries along his clean 3.5.7 installation ? Would he need to install anything else or just the libraries ? Would it be more appropriate to run the codesys editor with the {--profile="Codesys 3.5.3"} parameter ? (What would he need to install besides the 3.5.3 libraries in order to do so ? - the libraries alone are not enough)I hope the question is stated clearly enough, but please let me know if clarifications are needed. The reason for asking this is not due to any specific project that we have, just a way of planing ahead how to make sure projects we work with will be maintainable in the future.(Before you ask: unfortunately we work with collaborators that do not always provide project archives and there's no way around that)Thank you for any pointers,cheers
