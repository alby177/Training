Hello!  I have PLC based on  Intel® Celeron® 827E 1.4 GHz, single-core CPU. OS is QNX or Linux. Can I run CodeSys runtime on this PLC. Where can I find information on this topic?

Hi.Look for the SoftPLC of the CODESYS Runtime on the CODESYS website. Also have a look at the brochure in the Download section.A firmware image for the Raspberry Pi with the CODESYS Runtime (2h-Demo) is available through the CODESYS store.Regards,Martin
