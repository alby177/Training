Hi,Has anyone looked at implementing Codesys on the Siemens IOT2040 device?I would think it would make an ideal target - open, capable, UL approved, 24V powered...Quote:SIMATIC IOT2040 from the SIMATIC IOT2000 product series at a glanceEnergy-saving Intel Quark processor and numerous interfaces: Intel Quark x1020 (+Secure Boot), 1 GB RAM, 2 Ethernet ports, 2 x RS232/485 interfaces, battery-backed RTCYocto Linux SupportCan be easily expanded with Arduino shields und miniPCIe cardsVarious options for programming in high-level languagesCompact design and DIN rail mountingProven SIMATIC quality offers great ruggedness, reliability and longevityhttp://w3.siemens.com/mcms/pc-based-automation/en/industrial-iot/pages/default.aspxYou could easily make custom Arduino shields to add functionality as needed.Regards,Peter

Hi,a SoftPLC for the IoT2000 series is already in the development. The first release is scheduled for June 2017 (CODESYS V3.5 Servicepack 11). A preview was visible on the Embedded World Show in March and the CODESYS Users Conferences. It was maybe for the very first time that a Siemens device was handling EtherCAT I/Os   Stay tuned - the SoftPLC will be offered in the CODESYS Store quite soon...

I look forward to testing it when available. Will it support Web Visualization? PJE

I does not support CODESYS WebVisu in my preliminary Version, but it is very likely included in the release. I am not sure whether the colleagues will manage to integrate all requested features within the first "shot".Anyway: We are looking forward to having that SoftPLC, too

Hi,the SoftPLC is now available: https://store.codesys.com/codesys-control-for-iot2000-sl.html

Hi all.Is this softplc hard realtime?How is maxjitter?

Hi Josep,if you would apply a rt_preempt patched Linux kernel, this would be possible without modification of the plc runtime to have realtime capabilities,@PJE  Webvisu will be in on 3.5SP11Patch1 release.BREdwin

Thanks Edwin.I supose that thap patch makes the kernel hard real time(+-7us max jitter), not like raspi patch which has +- 100 us.

Hi Edwin, Does 3S built in support for SIMATIC IOT2000 IO-Shield ?link for shield:http://w3.siemens.com/mcms/pc-based-aut ... 0io-shieldBRIvan

I managed to install 3.5.11 on my IOT2040 and have a simple program running.... Thanks.I have a few questions:1. Any chance of a IOT2000 section in the forum like the BeagleBone and Raspberry PI? It would be nice to keep all the information together.2. Any information on access to Siemens I/O shield, as mentioned above by banzai35.3. Hardware implementations for Storage, Serial, Ethernet (fieldbusses). Can I have access to a folder on the MicroSD card or a USB memory device?4. How are persistent variables handled?5. When will Patch 1 be available for Webvisu?6. Any information on installing the real-time (rt_preempt) kernel as mentioned above? I use Codesys to hide all the complex stuff underneath ;0)It would be nice to put together a set of simple example programs to highlight the use of the units integrated functions.Regards,PJE

Hi PJE1. Any chance of a IOT2000 section in the forum like the BeagleBone and Raspberry PI? It would be nice to keep all the information together.hm.. let me check2. Any information on access to Siemens I/O shield, as mentioned above by banzai35.yes good chance to get it will take some time3. Hardware implementations for Storage, Serial, Ethernet (fieldbusses). Can I have access to a folder on the MicroSD card or a USB memory device?yes should already work4. How are persistent variables handled?not implemented at the moment -  where is it located physical address etc ?5. When will Patch 1 be available for Webvisu?next week I guess6. Any information on installing the real-time (rt_preempt) kernel as mentioned above? I use Codesys to hide all the complex stuff underneath ;0)almost the same process like with other Linux Systems.. - guess for IOT there is a Yocto build environment available? Isn't it?BREdwinIt would be nice to put together a set of simple example programs to highlight the use of the units integrated functions.

Thanks. I'll see what I can do on examples and the real time kernel, and post what I can.Sent from my Nexus 7 using Tapatalk

Hi Edwin &  Roland Wagner  Codesys expert,I am also Crazy used codesys and IOT2040 partner,but i only can do codesys on windows based and did not know how to install codesysy runtime in IOT2000 image (Yocto linux ).Could you let me know how to build up codesys runtime in IOT 2040 ?BR,Peter

Hi,where exactly do you stuck?Use the Update IOT Command to do it:BREdwin

Hi Edwin,in fact i  not know how to start use codesys in IOT2000.i usually only use codesys windows base , and ony use Putty have  command line for IOT2040 node-red application ,so i like to know how to first step up codesys in iot2040 , does have any document let me know how to quick start in to codesy based on iot2000 series for test sample  application?and what kind tools i need prepare?BR,Peter

Hi,I'll attach an example project with webvisu (download the project to your IOT device and start it) After deploying the rutime by the update tool to the IO deviceYou could access the visu by:http://IOT_IPAdress:8080/webvisu.htmBREdwin

Hi all,When access to Siemens I/O shield for IoT 2000 will be ready?BRbanzai35

Hi,at the moment I have no date for this.BREdwin

Hi Edwin,It not look like same Putty software tool,1.) Where i can get your photo show IOT2000  download software tool ?2.) Does your software is download what's software to IOT2000? is for codesys runtime setup to IOT2000?3.) Have any operation manual for me to enable start use codesys in iot2000Many thanks!BR,Peter

Hi Peter,this is the webvisu example from Raspberry Pi package (the project is in the Forum post embedded too)Basically the steps are the same if you use IOT like using Raspberry PI1. install the package for IOT by clicking on the cart in CODESYS - search IOT , install2. restart CODESYS3. use the roject from the post (open it in CODESYS)4. deploy the IOT runtime by - Tools -> Update IOT2000 command (scan your IOT and install the runtime)5. Now you could scan the IOT in the CODESYS Commuciation go online and work with itBREdwin

Helloi have got a raspberry PI3 and a SIEMENS IOT SIEMENSi have make a small program to test it.I have program it in SFC to test.I use for my application :- WAGO 750 Ethernet IP I/O (1x16 inputs 24VDC + 1x16 outputs 24VDC + 1x2 analog Output +/-10VDC)- Raspberry PI3 + Raspi TouchScrenn 7''when i change Raspi to IOT it working exactly same (except for the screen no possibility to use raspi screen on)

Hello,is it possible to use the RS485 on the IOT  ?Chris

This equipment has the same problem as the raspberry pi?2. If we do not turn off correctly, do we lose the information of the persistent variables?3. The operating system can be corrupted just like the sd in a raspberry pi?Regards
