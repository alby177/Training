Is it possible to use Boolean variables in recipes?I get an error when I try to do it.

Never tried it myself but I would try to pack them into words.  That might also be more memory efficient if that matters to you.

This works, but not with direct addressed I/O.Copy the values to other global or local variables and use these.
