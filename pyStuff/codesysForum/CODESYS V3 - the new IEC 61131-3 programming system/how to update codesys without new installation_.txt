is there some way to update Codesys IDE (patch or service pack) without install new version and to uninstall the old one? just an "upgrade"

Hi,uninstall is not needed,I would recommend install the new version in the same directory as the old one exists.Afterdoing that both versions are possible to use.BREdwin
