I have 2 bool arrayskey_alarms: ARRAY[0..0] OF ARRAY[0..15] OF bool;no_alarms: ARRAY[0..0] OF ARRAY[0..15] OF bool;no_alarms is an empty array -all false or all 0'sI would like to compare that if any bool of key_alarms is high/true/1, set another bit.I have tried GT and NE functions with these 2 arrays as inputs and receive an error as below.                ------ Build started: Application: Device.Application -------                typify code ...[ERROR]         garagepi: key_faults [Device: PLC Logic: Application](Network 16 / Operator 'NE' (Impl)): C0068:  Compare not possible on objects of type 'ARRAY [0..0] OF ARRAY [0..15] OF BOOL'What function would allow me to compare these 2 arrays of inputs within a ladder program?

Correct declaration of bool array may help.Code:key_alarms: ARRAY[0..15] OF bool;no_alarms: ARRAY[0..15] OF bool;

A BOOL is not a BIT (BOOLs in CoDeSys are byte-sized by default).  So you are really trying to compare a structure (a chunk of bytes). IF Struct1 = Struct2 will not work - you cannot also do Struct1 := Struct2. You have to compare each element. Your hardware source or the system libraries should have a function (for copy, I know there is a SysMemCopy or something like that). Sorry, I am not in front of my PC, so I cannot give you the exact item.

Thank you. I changed array[0..15] of Bool to array[0..0] of INT. These I can compare with math operators.
