I've got a problem with simulation in CodeSys HMI.I created an ActiveX component and in order to play a movie I made my own .dll library. It works fine in CodeSys simulation: Attachment:mov1.pngBut when I start the program in CodeSys HMI simulation, it doesn't work. The movie isn't loaded:Attachment:mov2.pngHere is the code of dll library:Code:// dllmain.cpp : Defines the entry point for the DLL application.#include "stdafx.h"#include <unknwn.h>#include <exdisp.h>//#include <wmp.h>#import "wmp.dll" no_namespace named_guidsBOOL APIENTRY DllMain( HMODULE hModule,                       DWORD  ul_reason_for_call,                       LPVOID lpReserved                ){   switch (ul_reason_for_call)   {   case DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH:   case DLL_THREAD_ATTACH:   case DLL_THREAD_DETACH:   case DLL_PROCESS_DETACH:      break;   }   return TRUE;}extern "C" __declspec (dllexport) void ExecuteActiveXCall(IUnknown* pUnk, char* pszId, char* pszParam){   if (strcmp(pszId, "Wideo1") == 0)   {      IUnknown* pNewUnk;      IWMPCore* url;      BSTR MyBstr = SysAllocString(L"put.wmv");      pUnk->QueryInterface(IID_IWMPCore, (void**) &pNewUnk);      url = (IWMPCore*) pNewUnk;      if (url)      {         url->put_URL(MyBstr);      }   }   else if (strcmp(pszId, "Wideo2") == 0)   {      IUnknown* pNewUnk;      IWMPCore* url;      BSTR MyBstr = SysAllocString(L"funnycats.mp4");      pUnk->QueryInterface(IID_IWMPCore, (void**) &pNewUnk);      url = (IWMPCore*) pNewUnk;      if (url)      {         url->put_URL(MyBstr);      }   }}Does anybody know how to solve this problem?

How big are the movies? Is it possible to put them in the PLC's memory and have the PLC webserver provide them? Or, is it possible that you are using relative paths and the active directory has changed? Can you try using absolute paths instead?

Quote:How big are the movies? Is it possible to put them in the PLC's memory and have the PLC webserver provide them?17MB~ and 4MB~. Yes, it's possible, but Windows CE 5.0 in my EATON XV102 controller doesn't support Windows Media Player so I can't even see a 'window' of WMP in a browser. Quote:Or, is it possible that you are using relative paths and the active directory has changed? Can you try using absolute paths instead?Hmm, when I changed paths to absolute ones: Code:BSTR MyBstr = SysAllocString(L"C:\Users\Kamil\Desktop\project1\put.wmv"); there is no reaction in both simulations.AndCode:(L"put.wmv") means that the movie is inside the directory of the project of course. In CoDeSysHMI simulation when I'm clicking the button 'Wideo' it is showing "Multimedia processing.." for 0,5sec(and blinking) and then it is turning to "ready"("ready" means "gotowy" in the screenshot).Any other solutions?
