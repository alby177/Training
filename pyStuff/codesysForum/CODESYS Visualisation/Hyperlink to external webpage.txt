[quote="TimvH"]this is possible with the option execute program with this parameter:INTERN LINK http://www.google.com/[/quote]This works well for me, but only in CoDeSys -> Visualisation interface. In the browser - nothing happens when clicking on the object?!

It definately works OK. You probably did something wrong.

The situation is the same with access control. - [url]http://forum-en.3s-software.com/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=1893[/url]

Do you test this in Internet Explorer?Is the webserver in the PLC, then I would suggest contacting the vendor of this PLC.If you use the Control Win or Control RTE, then it must be a setting in your PC.
