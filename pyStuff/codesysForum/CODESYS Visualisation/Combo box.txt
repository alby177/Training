Hi,

Is there a way to create a combo to select a list of choices ? I'm very confused, it's a basic widget.
If there is nothing to do that, what alternative we can used ?
I'm using CoDeSys 2.3.9.13.

Thanks,
Romuald.

you can use table for this and if you click on a cell you can see which cell is clicked.
a pull down is impossible. (however when invisible is used also possible)
