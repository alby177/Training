I note the pushbuttons do not have a tap option i.e. they are "latching".I also note the symbols (e.g. fast forward and fast rewind) do not have tap options.Is there and easy way to add a tap (momentary state change) to a visualization element?

Hi , As far as I know you can do that in Push switch.. You need to change Element behaviour from 'Image toggler' to 'Image tapper' and that should do..

Thanks, it works for Pushbuttons.
