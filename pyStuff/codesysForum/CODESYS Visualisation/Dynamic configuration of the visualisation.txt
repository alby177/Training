I am working on a project where I am using Codesys for only the visualisation which will communicate directly with the CAN network using Can open protocol. 
I want to make my visulisation screens using CoDeSys as generic as possible so that I can use the same screens for some other project too but with different variables and their properties.So I need to know that is it possible to convert my visualisation into some editable file format i.e CSV, txt etc. so that according to the requirement I can edit that file with different variables and properties to be used in the other project that also have similar visualisation screens and convert it back to Visualisation?

Lookin forward to get any help or valuable ideas regarding this.

Best Regards,
Rajat Bansal
