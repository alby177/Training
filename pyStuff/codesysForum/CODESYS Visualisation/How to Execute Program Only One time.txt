Hai Everybody 

                          I had developed a program in Codesys , I want to run the program only once. I have defined in the task manager that the program should execute cyclic. I think that if i can run the program on trigger of event i can run that once. let me please know how to set this i.e how to run a program on trigger of an evrnt.


  Any response is apprectiated

 Thanks and Regards.

You can call a progam from an other program
use the PLC_PRG (cyclic) to call RUN_ONCE (once)
Code:if bOnce=false then    RUN_ONCE; (*runs only when bOnce is false*)    bOnce:=true;end_if
