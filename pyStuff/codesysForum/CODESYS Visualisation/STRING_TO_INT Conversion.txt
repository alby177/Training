Hi Everybody

                   I want to know in which library supports the conversion functions like STRING_TO_BOOL,STRING_TO_INT etc. 

 I am using STRING_TO_INT function in codesysprogramming and i would like to know that can i get more details on conversion type functions. I want to link my global variabels to the program variabels. Let me know how it can be done.

The conversion functions are not part of a library. 
What do you mean by link?
