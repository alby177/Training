I am trying to find a solution for a problem I have with CoDeSys 2.3 and a Linux based controller (Berghof's DC 10xx).There is an FTP client which updates an image inside controller's FTP server in regular time intervals. I want to show this image whenever it is updated in target visualization.I used the bitmap tool and I uploaded a sample photo from local hard disk. Then I located the photo inside the controller and updated it via FTP client.Sadly the image updates only on boot of the controller. I tried change between two identical visualizations but it doesnâ€™t work. Is there any function or parameter I can use in order to dynamically change the bitmap?Achilleas

with a link this should be possible, not when you put it in your code, lets try this.
