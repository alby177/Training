Hi i set "Client settings" to 3 but i still can connect with more than 3 and GLOBALCLIENTID for next clients is -1 what this number this means???

Hi,nope this is not really possible by this settings the VisualisationManager, these settings are more or less 'default' setting for memory allocation for the these Clients.BREdwin

Hi Edwin, is there a way to switch client id from -1 faster?? when allocated ID's available..Also i want if it's possible to deny connection to server to clients, if queue is bigger than 1xn.
