Can anyone tell me what the arrguments are for the IsKeyPressed function?

Specifically, what are the values for nKeyCode (INT) and nInfo (INT)?

Hello,

I would be glad to get these too. 
Indeed I took a look at the function description in the SysLibTargetVisu.lib in the libraries manager but I could not manage to find the appropriate arguments.

I thought: 
- nKeyCode was the keyboard code of the key (eg.: 60 for a "q" on a QWERTY keyboard)
- bUp had to be set to FALSE if that's the down state of the key that is to be detected.
- nInfo ... no idea, the ASCII code??

But as I said this seemed not to be correct (according to the results it gave me at least).

Thanking you in advance, 
Best regards,
