Hello, I'm currently looking into the possibility to make custom graphical components for CoDeSys V2.3. Anyone who knows if this is possible?

I've looked att the ActiveX import component, but it seems as if the comunication is oneway. It would work for importing a videostream or so but if I want more functionality from my controls.
