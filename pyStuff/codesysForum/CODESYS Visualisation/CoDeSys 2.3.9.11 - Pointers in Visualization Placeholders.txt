Could you please tell me whether the following is a bug or a known limitation of the Visualization on some targets.

I am creating Visualization placeholders and I am associating fields of a data structure with the displayed data, e.g.:

TYPE EATON_PUMP_TUNEUP_VIS_DATA :STRUCT var1 : POINTER TO BOOL; var2 : POINTER TO WORD;  var3 : POINTER TO REAL;       .....END_STRUCTEND_TYPE

and using it inside the visualization placeholder like this:
$EATON_PUMP_TUNEUP_VIS_DATA$.var1^$EATON_PUMP_TUNEUP_VIS_DATA$.var2^$EATON_PUMP_TUNEUP_VIS_DATA$.var3^

Then, when I use this visualization placeholder I assign an instance of EATON_PUMP_TUNEUP_VIS_DATA to the placeholder.

I need to used POINTER TO BOOL, rather than just BOOL, since I want to allow user input through these Visualization elements and also because the data populating the instance of EATON_PUMP_TUNEUP_VIS_DATA comes from more than 1 source.

This works as I expected in Simulation Mode, but it doesn't work when I download the project to the real target: it only displays "???" and it doesn't accept any input.

Would there be a workaround for this issue?

Thank you

If you search the online help term placeholder, you can read some restrictions about the use of placeholder, like : 
"Pointer variables :  Pointer variables like PLC_PRG.pdw2^ cannot be monitored. This function will be realized with CoDeSys 3.0."

Best regards
