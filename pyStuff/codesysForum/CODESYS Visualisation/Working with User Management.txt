I am trying to get a basic check dialog in place for a change to a critical parameter. I have a requirement that a before a particular change can be made the current user must re-enter their password, and a user from a 'supervisors' group must enter their name and their password. See below for an image. When OK is pressed I want to revalidate both passwords and then take appropriate action.I'm struggling to get enough visibility of how the User Management is structured to be able to put this together.I have inspected the VisuUserMgmtDialogs.library and found that these dialogs reference the UserManagement system through dialog parameters. I haven't found out how to access what these are set to when the dialog is called, as the user management dialogs are a special case.I have looked through the VisuUserManagement library and found the VisuUserMgmt function block, which I think has the Methods I want CheckLogin and CheckLoginWithGroupID - but I'm not sure these are correct - as I don't want to login - just check the password.I also need to understand how users and group ID's relate. Somehow I ned to identify to the dialog which group of users is the 'supervisors ' group.I'm not sure if I'm just not finding the relevant documentation, or reference project. Any tips much appreciated.
