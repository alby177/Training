Hello,I use CODESYS V3.5 SP7 Patch 3I've got 2 visualization problems.1°) First problem :I drew a SFc Module called SFC1. The initial step is called Init.I then use the 'Generate SFC Visualization' command. I got a visualization called SFC1_SFC_VISU.When I look at how the first step is animated I found :{implicit on} SFC1.SFCCurrentStep = '' OR SFC1.SFCCurrentStep = 'Init' {implicit off}And for the animation of the transition :{implicit on} SFC1.Init__to__Step0{implicit off}It works well.   But if my firts setp (the initial one) is not called Init, but ST0 for example :For the animation of this first step we have :{implicit on} SFC1.SFCCurrentStep = 'ST0' {implicit off}The test blank value does not exist.So when I start the controller that first step does not change color.   If I manually added "SFC1.SFCCurrentStep = '' OR " it works.And for the animation of the transition :{implicit on} SFC1.Init__to__Step0{implicit off}The name of the step does not change in the expression !   2°) Second problemEven if I use sep name Init, Step 0, Step1 for a little sfc test.When I transfert the project into the PLC (I use CODESYS Control ...) I get 1 error for each tranisiton : Invalid expressions {implicit on} Grafcet1.Init__to__Step0{implicit off} configured ; Invalid expressionInvalid expressions {implicit on} Grafcet1.Step0__to__Step1{implicit off} configured ; Invalid expressionInvalid expressions {implicit on} Grafcet1.Step1__to__Init{implicit off} configured ; Invalid expressionI can run my program, but none changes color when the SFC is changing.    Thank you in advance for your answers.  Best regard

Hello Joel,I faced same Problem. Just enable in the properties of your SFC the SFCCurrentStep and it will work!RegardsRalph

Hello RalphI am glad for your answer !You're right, it works better, but a small problem persists :Instead of :     {implicit on} SFC1.SFCCurrentStep = '' OR SFC1.SFCCurrentStep = 'ST0' {implicit off}I get :     {implicit on} SFC1.SFCCurrentStep = 'ST0' {implicit off} The test blank value still does not exist, and this step is not coloured at the start of the PLC.But everything else works well.Bests regards
