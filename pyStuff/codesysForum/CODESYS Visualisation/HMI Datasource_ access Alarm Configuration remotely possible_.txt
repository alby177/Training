Hello everyone,I'm working on a project where I'm using Codesys V3.5 SP10 Patch 1. This version allows me to connect easily an HMI Device Project to my PLC Device project, though I'm facing a small obstacle.On my PLC project I have an Alarm configuration and a visualization with an alarm table, which would be used directly by the operator of a certain machine. So, I would also like to have access to the previously mentioned Alarm configuration on my HMI project...from what I read in the Help and I quote: "If you intend to use a remote alarm configuration, then you have to specify the name of the remote application here. If you do not specify anything, the alarm configuration will be located locally." I should be able to do this, I'm just wondering how? Is it possible to do it using the Datasource Object? Or do I need to set up a different type of communication?If anyone can give me some pointers on how to do this I would appreciate it very much!Thank you for your help!
