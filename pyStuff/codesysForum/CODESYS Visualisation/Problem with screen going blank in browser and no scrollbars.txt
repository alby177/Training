I have a wago 750-841 visualization with the latest version of codesys 2.3.  I am having a problem where my visualization sometimes comes up blank by default.  I need to go to the address bar and press <ENTER> and then it comes in (maybe 30 seconds later).I was also not getting scrollbars if the applet was bigger than my window.  I inserted this into the <BODY> of the webvisu.htm page: style="overflow: auto; width:1024px; height:768px;"It appears to have put in scrollbars for the required size, but when I try to scroll, guess what?  The screen goes blank.  The only way to get it back is to reopen the browser or keep hitting refresh and eventually it shows up, however, I still can't scroll.  It puts me to the top of the screen again.Ideas?  This is driving me nuts and I just can't figure out what is going on!

Figured it out.  I also modified another tag to this and all scrolls fine.  It previously had 100% instead of the px numbers.  No disappearing data now.<APPLET CODEBASE=. CODE=webvisu/WebVisu.class name="WebVisu" width="1024px" height="768px" id="webvisuapplet">
