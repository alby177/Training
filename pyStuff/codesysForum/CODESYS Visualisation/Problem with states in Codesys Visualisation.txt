Hello Everyone.I have a few quesions about the Codesys Visualisation.Firstly, I want to show a status of pump work (or other devices). I drew a circle (basic symbol in the Codesys). Could you tell me where I can put variable of program in the properties of this circle? I want only to display status of pump (for example alarm or work), I don't want to control this graphic (I don't want to control in by clicking). In properties there is only an option 'invisible' when variable is 'true'.Secondly, I drew a line (basic symbol). I want it to be visible only when the variable is 'true'. This situation is the same as in the previous case: When variable of program is 'true', then line is invisible. How to do that?Thank you in advancedGreetings
