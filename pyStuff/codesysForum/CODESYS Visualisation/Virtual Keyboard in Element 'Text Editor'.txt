Hello! How to activate the virtual keyboard when entering text in a text editor? My system - Web visualization and raspberry pi3. Thank you!

I don't try but I thinked it will be automaticaly open when user click on it. But, you can link it manualy with the mouse click event of your text editor properties.

Did you try to modify the 'Default text input' in the 'Webvisualization' settings?
