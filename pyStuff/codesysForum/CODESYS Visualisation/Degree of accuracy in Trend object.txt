For Trending, CoDeSys demands: [Degree of accuracy] > 50 msec. This is probably because the visualization task (VISU_TASK?) spends a corresponding amount of time, and the worst-case timevalue is visible internaly to CoDeSys, which therefor limits accordingly ?  In this case, is it possible to override this limitation (assuming that the real execution time for the visualization is significantly lower than 50 msec) ?

make a table when needed faster because trend is very slow, and not supported.
the trend has lots of software around it and is in the plc also slow.

Thank you very much for your response!
A table/array allows me to store each sample, yet how can I visualize the samples as a trend (without using the built-in CoDeSys Trend object) ?  Do I have to forward  the samples table/array via the fieldbus and then visualize the trend on the connected computer ?

do the trending yourself so with a pointer where it should write new data and a pointer where you took data.
so program something like
position a is added 1
put variable on place a in array
when array full start over again.

when showing start at a and then till end, then start from zero until a that makes the circle round again.

it is lot faster as to shift all data one place every time.
