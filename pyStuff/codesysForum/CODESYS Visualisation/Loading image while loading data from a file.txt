Good evening,I am working on an application that loads and writes information on quite big files, so while the loading and writing is being held I would like to show a "loading" image. Is it possible to add a ".gif" animation to do this?If anybody has any other idea about this, I am open minded!Thanks in advance

yes , however i would use the visible switch for this.just put it visible while loading. to prevent lots of communication.

I use it as you told me but when I download it and run the application the gif does not move.Thanks a lot!
