Hello
Has anybody run web visualisation on a Linux workstation? I tried last time and went into troubles with national characters, and 'ยง' characters ( words in strings in xml files, no idea why, are separated with the 'ยง' char) they display as squares  Any idea what to do?

The other question is: Is there a possibility to run a visualisation on PC simply by opening a webvisu.htm file with a browser without PLC connected? I don't mind if variables won't change.

Thanks in advance
