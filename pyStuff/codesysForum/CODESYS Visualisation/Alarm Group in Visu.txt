(MXPro 2.3.9 = CoDeSys 2.3.9.5)
I'm new to codesys (coming from the S7-world).  In the integrated Visu I have made an alarm table.  I want to have a complete alarm overwiev by addressing all my alarm groups in this table (the uppermost point, called "system" - being a folder in the alarm configuration), but it cannot address more than one single group - one level down.  What is the trick?

Regards
Kalle

yes it is possible to use the alarm table but it does have some hickups.

so make your own tables in one dimension arrays and use that on screen.
grouping is now possible by swapping it to another table or use pointers to them.

Hi!
I have learned that this is fixed in the latest version (2.3.9.18 ).
There is a  new selectable group called "All Alarm Groups".  It works fine in my testproject (simulator).
