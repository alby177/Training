Hi, i wonder if anybody has run into similar problem?

For some reason the buttons in the visu stay pressed if the click is not slow enough... if you click on it fast it wont do it...

im wondering is it still sending a loop of data while its pressed or is it a gui error????

any help would be appreciated

Regards,
Ricardo.
