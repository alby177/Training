Hi,I've created a table where I display an array with alarms. Is it possible to color-code each row separatly in the table depending on values in the alarmarray? Either font-color or background-color would be fine. //Luetin

yes that is possiblesend me your program and i will look into it. (please as an rarred export file)it is dependent how you organized the table.and you can always use a rectangle having a color.
