I have come across this strange problem that I created a visual that was longer than the screen. At the bottom of the visual are some buttons as well as the top.  When the visual is first opened when mousing over a button it works just fine. If I scroll down (Fails in both horizontal and vertical and tested on three different computers same CoDeSys V2.3.9.11) The location of where the mouse thinks the button is and where the button is currently at is off. I did about 1 hour of testing and the more you scroll the more the mouse alignment to the button becomes skewed. So by the time I scroll down to the bottom buttons I can be as far as two buttons off when using the mouse. It does not happen in simulation mode only when you are online with a target. I feel this is a bug in CoDeSys. I am currently using 2.3.9.11. It is hard to explain. Basically what it looks like is CoDeSys thinks your buttons are in one location before you scroll (On first opening of the visual). Then when you scroll the screen moves (Image) but the location of where the buttons are according to CoDeSys didn't scroll with the screen. So I can press into an empty area but it is actually pressing a button that is 10mm down the screen.

yes seen it, it is because your resolution is too high, and yes it is combination of java and codesys.the plc does not know when scrolling the screen, so it stays on position.just enter correct screenresolution.

How do you enter correct screen resolution? This is a connection from CoDeSys IDE connected to the PLC in online mode. The screens are not embedded in the application.
