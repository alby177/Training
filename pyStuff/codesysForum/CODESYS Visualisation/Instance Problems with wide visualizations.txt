I am having problems inserting instances of visualizations into a visualization that is 3,000 pixels wide (more than a screen width).

The inserted visualization has a variable attached to x-offset.

If the program is simulated and the x-offset set to a small value the object is drawn.  As the x-offset is increased the object sometimes disappears.  When the x-offset is greater than 1 screen the scrollbars do not always show.

I have tried this with just 1 line in the instance visualisation and the same thing happens.

If I try the same with a line on its own (not using an instance visualization) everything works.


Codesys version 2.3.5.1
