Hi to all.
Friends can someone tell me that whether it is possible to do sorting settings ( date/time , priority, alarm class, alarm state) of my alarm table during runtime in codesys 2.3 ? if possible than how?

Any response would be appreciated.
Regards,
Rajat Bansal

Hello Paul deelen,
      By manual do you mean codesys help because I can not find anything like oscat in it ? Would you please tell me what is a oscat and how to go furthur?
Cheers and regards,
Rajat Bansal

with manual i mean the written manual or m933302e.pdf on the CD deliveredf when buying the program.
use page 44 and further.

oscat is a library available for codesys search for version 161
by using www.oscat.de
