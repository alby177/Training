I would like to use an active-x tree control on a visualization screen to navigate hierarchically organized PLC objects.  I have downloaded and examioned the example and have a few questiuoins.1.  From the exampe it appears that one must recreate any of the original controls methods that one wishes to use.  It's not clear how binding between the newly created wrapper method and the underlying activeX method.  Is it done by method and parameter name?2.  The tree controls I have looked at (Windows standard) also have Propertie and Events that would seem to be essential.  Are they supported by the ActiveX wrapper element?  If so how?3.  Are there any additional Visu element libraries available?  Is it possible for thrid parties to create additional elements?  If so what is required?
