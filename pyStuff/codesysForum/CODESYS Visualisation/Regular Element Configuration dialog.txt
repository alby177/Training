Hello,

I am using CoDeSys v2.3.9.11 and I see to to variables for "Conversion base" and "Conversion factor".  If this is what I think it is where I can swap a scaling factor or conversion constant.  If anyone has sucessfully used this, can the give me some feedback on ways to code it into a program.  I have tried a couple things with no luck.

It is not in the documentation that I have with in CoDeSys v2.3 PDF or online help.

Kind regards,

Doug

As I have found quite often, as soon as I post or request help I stumble upon the answer.  I have figured out how to use it:



Conversion base     "number to be converted"
Conversion factor   "multiplication factor"
Textdisplay             "result"


Now for the new question, is the reason it displays correctly on my desktop IDE and not on my target because the target does not support these new conversion tools? 

Kind regards,

Doug Rilee
