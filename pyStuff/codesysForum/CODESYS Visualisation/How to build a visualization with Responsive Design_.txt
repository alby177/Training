Let's give some context:Let's say we have an industrial plant controlled by a PLC programmed with CODESYS V3 and we want to develop a Web Visualisation that works as the SCADA/HMI for the plant.  It's desirable to develop this visualisation in a way that allows the proper control of the plant using interchangeably a desktop PC, a _ or a smartphone. To achieve that is necessary to chose a different user interface philosophy for each category of devices in order to make the use of the SCADA as smooth as possible for each device.Once we have this 3 user interfaces designed and developed, we need to present one of them to the user depending on the device used to access to the PLC's web server. I see two ways of implement this:1) Provide 3 differents urls, for example:          - 192.168.1.110:8080/webvisu_desktop.htm          - 192.168.1.110:8080/_.htm          - 192.168.1.110:8080/webvisu_smartphone.htm   And instruct the user to use each of them depending on the device of choice.2) Automate this selection of user interface through a routine in the PLC.Obviously I would prefer to use the second option. The problem is that I haven't been able to figure it out yet in a satisfactory way. I based my attempts in 2 sources:          - The "Responsive Design Example" from CODESYS Store          - The "Sophisticated visualization with Responsive Design" conference give by 3S-SmartThe example it's not functional or at least I haven't been able to make it work as expected.However, tinkering with the methods mentioned in that 2 sources I managed to list all the clients connected to the Web Visualisation and to access to their VisuElems.VisuStructClientData structure.Within this data I've only found one thing useful: the resolution of the client.With this I can select the user interface depending on the resolution of the device screen (using a philosophy similar to the Store example). But this is useless giving that resolution is not necessarily related with screen size. For example, I've tried with these devices:           - Toshiba Laptop: 1366 x 768 - 16.3"           - iPad Air: 1536 x 2048 - 9.4"           - BQ Aquaris E5 (Smartphone): 1280 x 720 - 5"I mean, I also need the pixel density in orden to determine the screen size or getting the screen size directly.So, do you know a way of getting this data from CODESYS?If you think there is a better way to do this I would be pleased to read it too.Thank you in advance for your help.
