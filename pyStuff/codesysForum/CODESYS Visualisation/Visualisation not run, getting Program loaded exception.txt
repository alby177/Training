Codesys plc , we able run in simulation mode and tested logic.But visualisation  unable keep in run mode, getting error " Program loaded exception- License file invalid" Please give solution on this.

probably you copied, too much, save your program using export. Then reinstall the program or run the licencemanager.or start a new project with a free device. like softplcHowever this will also stop after time expired.
