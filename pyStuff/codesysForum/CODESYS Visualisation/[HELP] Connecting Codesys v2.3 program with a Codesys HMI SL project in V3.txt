Hi everyone,I'm trying to make a little proof of concept with this setup: - I make a silly program in Codesys v2.3 with an XC-CPU201-EC256K from EATON as Target. - I simulate the PLC with Codesys v2.3. - I make a HMI project with Codesys Development System v3 in order to create a visualization of the PLC that works with Codesys HMI SL (like shown in this webinar https://youtu.be/mIvH7L6U5P0).But I can't add the PLC as Datasource to the HMI project. I've tried changing the Communications Parameters but I don't know how to link the simulated PLC with the HMI project.Here you can see two screenshots of the situation:I would be very grateful if someone point me in the right direction.Thank very much in advance for your help.

Hi,hm.. you write:Quote:'- I simulate the PLC with Codesys v2.3.' this is the point I guess.You need to use a real plc, even if it is running under Windows for example PLCWinNT which is part of the CODESYS V2.3 installation .Then it should workBREdwin

I've just tried with PLCWinNT and now it works.Thank you very much, Edwin.
