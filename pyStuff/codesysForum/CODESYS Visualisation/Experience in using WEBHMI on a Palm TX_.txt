Hello,

I want to use the Web-server on a WAGO 750-841 to visualize some values. To browse through the visualisation I want to connect via wlan with my Palm TX. I have acces to the Webbased Management but if I push the WEBHMI button, it discontinues with a blank sheet.
Do anyone know how I could have success?

Thanks in advance,

Ralf

You need to have Java support (to show the java applets) which is not always available on PDA's. Check with your supplier whether this is included.
