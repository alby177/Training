Is it possible to target the Allen Bradley HMI for visualization? The HMI has OPC capability as well.

Wrong place. Can an admin move this over to visualization? Thanks

So the easy route is to actually set the URL in the PanelView's web object and point it to your device's webpage (i.e. IP:8080/webvisu.htm). This way, there's no need to create another HMI interface.
