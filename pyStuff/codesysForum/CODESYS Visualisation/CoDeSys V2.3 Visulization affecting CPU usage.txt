I am using CoDeSys V2.3 with Visulization and target is SP RTE.  I am using Windows XP box.  I am looking for tune up parameter using which i can control Visulization Screen refresh/ update time because what i have observed is, some time it takes upto 95% of CPU usage and stays there for a long time which affects other applications. As soon as i close visu screen or go offline then immidiately it reduces CPU usage and come back to normal level. I have done two improvments so far to make graphics more efficient.#1 : Usage of pointers which will work as indirect tagging to graphics and thru which i am able to handle more visu objects on screen.#2 : In my SP RTE System config i configured only 25% for RTE instead of default 50% believing that it will help to load and run other application.Any help regarding improving CPU usage while Online Visu mode will be highly appreciated.Thanks in advance.

do not move graphics but switch them on/off if needed.slow down the updater for the screenuse simple graphics, without bmp but simple colors.use a new java versiondo not use simulation as this slows down very much. better is use a dedicated PLC for the process.slow down the PLC program by using eventtimers this way the plc is not active all the time.
