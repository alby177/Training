Hi all,Is it possible to call a method from a visualisation?

Hello?

Hi,have you tried the execute ST-Code option?BREdwin

Yes I tried and could not make it work.Maybe I did it wrong. Is it supposed to work?

When I tried this I got the following error:"The input action Execute ST-Code has statements which are no assignments. This feature is only supported for the target visualization."

I'm assuming you are trying to assign your text variable a value?If you are, you need to set-up your text variable as a global variable and then put '%s' for strings or '%5.2f' for numbers in the Text property. The properties section is found in the visualization. Then in the Execute ST Code put something like 'Text_Variable:="STRING";' If you are trying to call a method whenever the text box is clicked, you need to write something like 'ClassObject.Method();' in order to call methods from function blocks inside the Execute ST Code command. Quick note about the Execute ST Code for input configuration, you can't press enter for a new line without exiting the input configuration. I recommend copying and pasting the code you want to put in there as a way to compensate for this bug.
