Is it possible to disable scroll bars for data entry points in web-visualizations. It seems that numerical and hidden text fields have no scroll bars but text fields default with scroll bars, even when the text width/height does not require scrolling.My users are getting confused: when they edit a field, the existing text is hidden to the left of the data-entry field and it is necessary to scroll left.

i can not duplicate what you are having please more info.have you put the text position in the middle and height too?

Hi Shooter,Attached please find pdf with screen shots that explains. Any advice would be welcome.

I can confirm the same thing in Chrome. I'd like a way to specify that the text field isn't a multiline field.
