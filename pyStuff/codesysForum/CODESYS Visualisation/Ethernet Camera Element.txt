Hi All,Is there any element available on tool box, that we can use for Ethernet Camera. I want to connect one of the Ethernet camera to my screen, i am using CodeSys V3.5 SP9 Patch 2 for visualisation. Is there any element and/or library that i could use to utilise this Ethernet Camera using its IP Address.Thanks in advance.
