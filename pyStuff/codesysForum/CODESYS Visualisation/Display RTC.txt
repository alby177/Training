Hi,Is it possible to display the real time clock of my 750-849?thanks

With CoDeSys there are libraries SysLibRtc.lib or SysLibTime.lib to get the real time clock.I think with your controller you must have the same libraries. 

for nice clocks have a look at www.oscat.de lots of functionsexample:(*version 1.2	8. mar. 2009programmer 	hugotested by		oscatDT_SIMU simulates a real time clock and can be adjusted to different speedsit can also be used in simulation to simulate a real time clock.the peed of the clock can be increased or decreased to debug timers.with the input start a start date-time can be specified.*)(* @END_DECLARATION := '0' *)(* read system timer *)tx := T_PLC_MS();tc := REAL_TO_DWORD(DWORD_TO_REAL(tx - last) * speed);IF NOT init THEN	init := TRUE;	DTS := Start;	tc := 0;	last := tx;ELSIF SPEED = 0.0 THEN	DTS := DWORD_TO_DT(DT_TO_DWORD(DTS) + 1);ELSIF tc >= 1000 THEN	td := (tc / 1000) * 1000;	DTS := DTS + DWORD_TO_TIME(td);	last := last + REAL_TO_DWORD(DWORD_TO_REAL(td) / speed);END_IF;(* revision historyhm	11. sep. 2008	rev 1.0	original versionhm	16. nov	2008	rev 1.1	added type conversions for compatibility reasonshm	8.	mar. 2009	rev 1.2	added increment by cycle mode*)END_FUNCTION_BLOCKjust one for you to get the idea the rest is at oscatyou can have it displayed with lines or with numbers.if needed more help just ask.

I tried using SysLibTime, but had issues (the time stayed at Jan 1, 1970, 12:00 AM). So, I decided to use the time string format. Just make a rectangle in your visualization, and set the text string to something like mine:Time:%t%I:%M:%S %pDate:%t%m/%d/%YUnfortunately, %I in the time string gives a leading zero for the hour, but I couldn't figure out how to remove it. For more info about the time string, you can click the ? button next to the Text field.Edit: Found out that SysLibTime doesn't work in Simulation. It did work on my Wago, but only when the program was running. %t strings, however, will always work, even when the program isn't running.
