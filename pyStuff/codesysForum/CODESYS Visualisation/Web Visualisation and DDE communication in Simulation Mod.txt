Hello,

Can I use web visualisation and DDE communication in simulation mode? (I want to show customers the abilities of the products.) If the unswer is yes, could you please describe or send demo files.

Thanks lot...

web visu can be done in the programming environment as the same screens are used
dde is a little trickier as the source is different but also possible.
you will have to write to a file instead of an input .or output.
