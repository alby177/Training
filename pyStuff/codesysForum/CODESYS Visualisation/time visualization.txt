I have a "TIME" variable to count how much time is working the PLC.What should I write into the "Text" field to have the time divided in hours, minutes and seconds?I have tried with %t but it does not work.Actually I am doing it with %s and I just see the values on minutes and seconds.Thanks for your help

With your visualization open, choose Extras:Settings:Date/Time. What do you see for the TIME/TOD field? Is Formatted time display checked?

Where is that "Extras" tab? I am working with a CoDeSys v3.4Thanks Musashi Aharon

in 2.3 it is %t this will give system time.
