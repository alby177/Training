HelloHave played around with differens controls but can't find a suitable one that works with my phone or _.Would like to have a textbox but can't find it, slider works great in my computer but not at all in my phone.Any suggestions, just need something to be able to change setpoints.

Found the VisuDialog.Numpad and it suits my needs perfectly.
