Is there a way to hide the mouse pointer in non-touch screen applications using Target Visualization? I have searched extensively on the Web and tried numerous registry keys in the Windows CE 5.0 registry with no success. Any ideas would be most appreciated.

You may be able to do this at the processor end however I don't know what sort of PLC/IPC you have.  Using Wago IPC for example it is possible to change the touch from USB to USB_nocursor.  Have a read up and see if you can do something like this.

Thanks for the relply. This application involves a Beckhoff CX1010 running Windows CE 5.0. We came up with a simple workaround for now, by writing a commnad line program to move the cursor off screen, which runs once on bootup and the problem is solved.

I will check the other suggestion though, of using USB_nocursor key. I will see if there is anything documented on this registry entry. Thanks for the tip.
