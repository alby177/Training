Is there any way to dictate how the user management dialogues pop up over your webvisu screen? I'm trying to design a control interface for a mobile device, but when calling the login dialogue or anything else for that matter, it tends to be opened centered. When selecting the text box, it also seems that every mobile browser wants to _ in to rescale the object. This ends up leaving me with only a small, _ in portion of the webvisu that I'm trying to access after login. Not only that, but the actual login fields tend to stop being rendered when this happens, leaving me to poke around until I find them again.Any help? I'm also thinking maybe it's better to roll my own login screen. Any documentation on that would be great.
