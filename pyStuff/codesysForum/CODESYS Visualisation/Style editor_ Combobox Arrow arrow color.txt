Hello,I'm using Codesys v.3.5.9 and I want to customize the visualization style. I have created my own style from the Flat style 3.5.9.0 with the Style Editor. All changes are good but, I have one problem with the combobox array arrow color, I have change the color of the box to a light gray and now the arrow isn't very visible (arrow in white by default):Attachment:combobox.pngI have not found the style entry that could change the color of the arrow: Attachment:2016-10-05_13h00_00.pngI have tried to add an entry as "Arrow-ArrowColor" like in the DateTimePicker but it doesn't work. Thank you in advance.
