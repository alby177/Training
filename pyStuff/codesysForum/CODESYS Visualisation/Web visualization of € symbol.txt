How can I do to insert the € character in the text property of a object for a Web Visualization?The € symbol is correctly displayed in the visualization inside the develpment tool, but into the XML file of Web Visualization is generated a &#128; sequence while to see the € symbol in Web browser must be used &#8364;

there is a difference in character coding, use the correct table. or use a manual character.
