Hello
J'm trying for training to use CoDeSys SP PLCWinNT and CoDeSys Webserver on a PC.
I Explain my idea : I have 2 PC. One, called PC1 with CoDeSys V2.3 and one other PC i want to use as Target (With CoDeSys SP PLCWinNT and CoDeSys Webserver, all of them are in demo mode).
PC1 and PC2 are connected on the same Ethernet LAN with goods address.
I can transfert my program (and the visualisation page which is called PLC_VISu) from PC1 to PC2 (target). My program works well !
But when i use my internet explorer(on PC1) to see the web visu (URL = http:/PC2 address:8080/webvisu.htm) i get an error message "Acces error : page not found - cannot start page for URL". 

I tried 2 explore : IE and Firefox, the result is the same.

Some questions :
1°) Is my idea possible ?
2°) When I look at the screen Webserver, I see 2 different addresses. One is the address of the webserver, the other is the address of the PLC. I have to edit the file "webserver_conf.xml" ?
3)) Someone has he already done that ?

Thank you in advance for any ideas.
Best regards

J found the error.
There is something wrong in the 
C:\Program Files\3S Software\CoDeSys V2.3\Visu\ webserver_conf.xml file 
--------------------------------------------------
<webserver-configuration>
<webserver-port-nr> 8080 </webserver-port-nr>
<target-port-nr> 1200 </target-port-nr>
<target-ip-address> localhost </target-ip-address>
<use-file-upload-dir> true </use-file-upload-dir>
<file-upload-dir> C:\Programme\CoDeSysV23\ </file-upload-dir> to be replaced by <file-upload-dir> C:\Program files\CoDeSysV23\ </file-upload-dir>
--------------------------------------------------
And its works perfectly !!
