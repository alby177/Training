Is there a way that when tapping or text displaying TON  make this look like (00:00) instead of (TOD#00:00:00) If I program a controller so as to someone can change time schedules the might not now what TOD# or T# means, I have tried many ways and It does not work, Can someone help me!

you will need some conversion from DWORD_TO_TIME or use real text and convert that in timesee www.oscat.de for this type of actions he made lots of time functions.
