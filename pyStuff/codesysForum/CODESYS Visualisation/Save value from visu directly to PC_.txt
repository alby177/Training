Hello.I have a PLC and a PC connected to it via serial interface.Is there any way that I can save a value from the Codesys Visualization directly on the PC (not on the PLC)? Can I do it by making use of some ActiveX functionality or some other way? How?Thank you,Lucian

if you use the simple serail connection nd you have a codesys running on the PC you can use DDEif not then you have to use OPC.

You can use Watch and recipes manager (from Ressources).With the recipe  manager you can save/restore value in a file on the PC. You can use it from the Codesys Visualization by using a button with "Execute Program" .Best regard  

Thank you for your answers, Shooter and Japib.Shooter, I am not that familiar with DDE and I read in the Codesys manual that you have to configure the GatewayDDEServer. Also, it says that the DDE interface becomes active when you login. But how can I acquire a PLC value and append that value in a file?Japib, your solution seems to work. Thank you for your insight.But what I am trying to do is some kind of sampling archive. I want to keep adding PLC values into a file on the PC, directly from the Codesys visualization, at certain times during the day, automatically.I cannot use recipes, as I have to manually save to file and I cannot append values. Or maybe I don't see it right.Do you see a way to do this?Sorry for not being specific the first time and thank you for your patience.Regards,Lucian

It seems that I have overlooked the history functionality provided by the trend element in the visualization.I can save the trend in a TRD file on my PC and the open it with Notepad.Thanks.Regards,Lucian
