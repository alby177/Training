I am using C167 platform with RS232 serial driver. 
1. Can This platform be updated to support web visualisation?
2. Will external "Serial to Ethernet" gateway help in this setup to access the webserver?
3. What updates are required? -- Memory(RAM/Flash/MMC), 
4. Can this platform be used with Ethernet? 
5. If updated to ethernet, can web visualisation be suppoted?
