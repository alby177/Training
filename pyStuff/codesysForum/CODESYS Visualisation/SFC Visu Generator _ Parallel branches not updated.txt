I played with the SFC Visu Generator , to display an SFC program , which has some Parallel branchesIn my test , i have observed the following:On entereing Parallel branches , the Visu shows this correctly (The first steps are active) , but as soon as one of the branches continue - (Next step in this branch) , the Visu will not correctly show active steps on the other paralell branchesIs there a way to accomplish this ?I attached 2 images, to show this situation, 1 for the running plc program , and 1 for the visu screen..TIAFrank S

Hello,I am also interested in this topic.It would also be very nice if the SFV Visu Generator would create visualizations for sub-SFCs, i.e. SFCs that are inside the SFC-steps.Right now they seem to be ignored.What I understood from the gernerated code is, that the SFCCurrentStep-Variable is used. This seems to be bad for sub-SFCs and parallel branches, because the SFCCurrentStep-variable only shows the name of one step, while there are much more active in parallel.WouldnÂ´t it be better to generate code that asks for the implicit <StepName>.x variable for each step?It is possible to manually change the automatically generated highlighting code to look for the .x, but the automatic generation would be much nicer.Best,Martin
