HiI would like to change the location of the webpage from "http://IP Address:8080/webvisu.htm" to "http://IP Address:8080". Is there a "default.htm" that can be used to load this webpage automatically?Thanks

Hi,this is not possible at the moment,but there is an entry in the improvement database.BREdwin

Ok, thanks!
