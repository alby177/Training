I am trying to define access rights to web visualisation trough Codesys programing interface with right mouse button over the object (e.g. PLC_VISU) -> Object properties -> Access rights. I am defining different passwords for different groups, but no matter what I do, when I try to access via web interface, it never asks for user name / password and I have full access to all objects.[attachment=0]CoDeSysAccR.PNG[/attachment]

Hello,J think you have to declare somes variables, for example :VAR_GLOBAL RETAIN	CurrentUserLevel: INT := 1;	CurrentPasswords: ARRAY[0..7] OF STRING[20] := 'aa','bb','cc','dd','ee','ff','gg','hh';	VisuDoExecuteUserlevelInit: BOOL := FALSE;END_VARWith : CurrentUserLevel : level of password you want to set on startCurrentPasswords : Array,  8 levels of passwordThen you can change User or Password by program, or in the pages of display you can add buttons.Add a button, and configure :Category -->Input -->Execute programINTERN CHANGEUSERLEVELINTERN CHANGEPASSWORDHoping to help you, sincerely.

Thank you JAPIBI tried with these declarations, but the result is the same. I forgot to say that all access restrictions work well in CoDeSys -> Visualisation interface, but in the web interface all items are available without any passwords. No matter with or without declarations for CurrentUserLevel, CurrentPasswords.... 

3S-Software has made an example for this. Go to their website and click on Download => CoDeSys Sample Projects.Through this ftp site go to Projects/CoDeSysV2.3/Visualisation/LoginDemo_XML/.This shows you how to handle a login through the web.

Hi!  where I can find some information about CurrentUsername and INTERN statement? I haven't found in the COdesys Help. May there is a tutorial online...THanks a lot.
