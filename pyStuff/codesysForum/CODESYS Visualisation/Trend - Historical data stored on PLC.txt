Hi, I have been trying to display historical data in Trend Visualization. I am using WAGO 750-841 controller option: Store trend data in the PLC, also option: History in Trend configuration. Trend data files (.trd) are successfully created and stored on PLC.Although, when I log into a PLC with CoDeSys (v2.3.8.35), Trend Visualization element displays only current data, for the time periods when I am/was logged in. Data stored in .trd files are not displayed.  Thanks,Dalibor

this trend thing is not running perfect, it is having some pointers running, do not rely on it. it is version dependent what happens.
