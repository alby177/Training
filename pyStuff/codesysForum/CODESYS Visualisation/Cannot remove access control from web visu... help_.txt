I'm using CODESYS control win v3.5.10.10At one point I set up online login and now whenever I connect to the webvisu server, the client is asked for login. I do not have user management set up on visualization manager. I need to clear all login dialogs from popping up. One of my webvisu's is a mobile oriented visu and the default login dialogs are cancer to work with using a mobile device. I need to be able to roll back to no access control of any kind, please anyone willing or able to help solve this issue would be much appreciated!

Please let me know if there's a more relevant board this should be posted in. I still cannot seem to default back to no user login when the webvisu is loaded up. Still requires Owner to sign in.

Hi,- remove the user management in the Project- reset original on the device- restart plc and download the Project without usermanagementBREdwin

Thank you Edwin,Reset origin was the only step I was missing. Thanks again.
