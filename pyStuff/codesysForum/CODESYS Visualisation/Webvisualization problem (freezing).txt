Hi I can see the Webvisu applet in a browser  but it doesn't work properly like the visualization into COdesys.The java console log the commands but the applet don't execute them. I tried this demo in firefox, chrome, internet explorer.For example I can't set a variable with a toggle button, the result is like a push button, may  be there is a write permission to set in codesys? I'm using ABB PM554 ETH on Automation builder 1.2.1. I added a webserver to the PLC with automation builder and all described in the manual Webvisualization.. Nobody has the same problem? My PC is new and JRE is version 9 Thank you for replies.
