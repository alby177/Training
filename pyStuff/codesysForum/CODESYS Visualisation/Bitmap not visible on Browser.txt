When adding a Bitmap in PLC_Visu, it works but when looking at the page with a browser, the picture is not displayed (IE7 & FFox).

All other variables are displayed properly, just the background image is missing.

Any ideas ?

Do you see a link to the image on the page?
Is the image in the right place to be referenced by the HTML?
What hardware are you using?

save the background on the plc.
when in simulation it comes from computer.
and as this is not possible in run mode you do not see the picture.
