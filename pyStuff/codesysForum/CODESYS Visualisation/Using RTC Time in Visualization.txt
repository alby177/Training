I'm using the "%t%a %b %d.%m.%y %H:%M:%S" format to display time and date on my visualization, so it will appear as "Wed Aug 28.08.02 16:32:45" for example. I know it uses the system time, but it gets it from my PC and not from the 750-640 RTC module. Is there a way to set it so it takes this time instead of the pc time?thanksMartino

I haven't used the 750-640 but I assume you will have to map one or several variables to the correct address. Then display that variable in your visualization.Best regards,Kristian BerlinEDIT: But what control system are you using?

you will have to use extra vars for this.This way you can show two different times.You can make your PLC time same as PC otherway around is not possible (not without using softPLC.

well then how can I show my time or date in the visualization without it showing TOD# or D#

use the vars from the RTC clock.something like RTC.hour etc.

aha that is formatting of text look in manual under time format.
