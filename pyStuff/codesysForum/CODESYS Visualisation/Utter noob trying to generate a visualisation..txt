Hi all.  First post here and all that jazz.Can anyone point me to a decent tutorial or guide of some sort for "getting started with CODESYS visualisations"?  I have programmed HMI's before now so have a little bit of a clue, but the Codesys stuff is an order of magnitude more complex than a Beijers screen.  I want to be able to ask sensible questions on here rather than utterly basic stuff that makes everyone roll their eyes.Thanks in advance.

Hello,I would watchs some clips on YouTube to start:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwNdvfFiPJIhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3NBG8ICCk0many more are availbale just google them.After that I would open visu example applications in the CODESYS store.Regardsplcmax
