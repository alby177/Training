Hello,
I have a problem with visualisation, it's a basic thing, I try to visualize a variable ( wich is a byte type), but  without success.
I put the name of the variable in Textdispaly field in Variables  category.
is it the right way to to that?
Thanks

You also have to have an entry in the Content field in the text catagory.  This is a format specifier similar to what is used in printf() function in C.

So, to display your byte as a base 10 number use %d, or to display it in hex, use %x

Hope this makes sense.
