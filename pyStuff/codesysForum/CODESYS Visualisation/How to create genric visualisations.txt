Hello,
I'd like to create generic visualisation for generic blocs with CoDeSys 2.3.6.1.

Do you have an idee how I can change the first part of name of all the variables in the window?
I try the command "projet - global replace" and select the visualizations files and give the old and new string but nothing is replaced.

I try to open the file *.pro with a text editor and replace the strings but it was a very bad idea!

If I have about 30 elements it take a long time to select each element and go to "configure - variables" to change the first part of the name of the variable!
I now I'm a bit lazy!
Thank for your advice

That sounds like Placeholder!

1. Create a visualization template by creating a new visualization 
2. Use instead of the direct variables inside the visu the placeholder concept (see attached help extract) 
3.Fit this visualization in the same Library as your Function Block 
4.Include the library to your project 
5.Insert the visu with ‘Insert Visualizatin’ select your visu 
6.Replace the Placeholder with the instancename of your function Block

Thanks for your answer
It's exactly what I need. After some hours of tests it work fine.
I don't now why I miss the pages in the visualization's manual?
