Hello,
Please I need Help, I downloaded the demo of CoDesys 2.3 ( with also CodeSysHMI), but I can't Open my visualization (wich I created with Codesys) with CodeSysHMI.
must I add some instructions at CoDeSysHMI.ini file?

There is anyone who know how to do that?

thanks

Hi!

I got my HMI working after I had read instructions (CoDeSys_Visu_V23_E.pdf). HMI should work if you write to windows command shell:

"C:\Program Files\3S Software\CoDeSys V2.3\CoDeSysHMI\CoDeSysHMI" /target D:\PROJECTS\PROJECT.PRO

Opens PLC_VISU visualization screen, if it exists in project. First path is where your CodesysHMI.exe is, and the second path is your project.

Hello 
The problem that I can't find the windows command shell, I put instructions in CoDeSysHMI.ini  but it doesn't work.

I don't know much about CodesysChip.ini, but command shell can be found from windows Start-menu.
Menu: Start/Run...    type cmd


I made my HMI starting from desktop icon. Pretty easy way. 
1)Open Notepad and write:"C:\Program Files\3S Software\CoDeSys V2.3\CoDeSysHMI\CoDeSysHMI" /target c:\Projects\Myproject.PRO
2) save as "LaserHMI.bat"

thanks Antti,

Could it be there are blank spaces in the target string? In that case you will recieve this message. Add quotes before and after the target string.

Not working: "C:\Program Files\3S Software\CoDeSys V2.3\CoDeSysHMI\CoDeSysHMI" /target c:\My Projects\Myproject.PRO
Working: "C:\Program Files\3S Software\CoDeSys V2.3\CoDeSysHMI\CoDeSysHMI" /target "c:\My Projects\Myproject.PRO"

There is a blank space between My and Projects. You have to add the quotes to make this work.

I probe that and this ok. Thanks for your response.
