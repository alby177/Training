I've noticed that Time Selector works not really well in the SP11.. To see 1 hour window on trend I need to set 1000h in Time Selector.  Is this a bug or is there something else need to be set. As far as I remember in SP10 there was a possibility to change resolutionfrom s to ms in trend properties (or something like that)but in SP 11 I cannot find that option..Best RegardsLukasz.

Looks like I have to reply to my own question..It looks like there is possibility to set resoultion in the Time Range Picker element : Attachment:Capture.PNGBut only before  attaching Trend element. After attaching, this option is not avaliable:Attachment:Capture1.PNGThat's why I was struggling to find it earlier   So if your trend is showing some weird thing , set this option to microseconds and it should be fine.(to be honest not sure why this option even exists as when set to ms time range picker is not working correctly)Hope it will help someone

I was struggling with the time selector too until I read this post. Really hard to find when the option is not available after attaching.Thanks again.
