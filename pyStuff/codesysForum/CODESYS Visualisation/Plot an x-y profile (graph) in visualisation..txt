I have to plot an x-y profile (graph) in visualisation. How can I do it?

You could prepare an array Y1[X1], Y2[X2]...etc. Next use Histogram with presentation options Curve. You will see the x-y spline curve.

Hello Igor, I'm interested about the x,y profile plot.
I try to do a curve histogram with an array like 
	Y:ARRAY[1..10] OF INT:=1,2,3,5,6,8,1,2,4,8;
but I see an empty histogram.
can you explain how it works.


thanks.

bye

I would do it with pieces of line and put them in an array.
much like your histogram but i can make drawings and even openings.
i made example with array and rectangles. changed them to lines so i have begin and endpoint.
also possible with line command with scale and direction.
scale is length of line

Thanks a lot.
It works. in my example was wrong only the variable.
I set "variable Y[1]" , the first item of the array and not the array
"variable Y"...

I will use it!

Bye
