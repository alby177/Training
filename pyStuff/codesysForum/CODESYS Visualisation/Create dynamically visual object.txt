Hi all,

Is it possible to create dynamically a visual object.
I want to show several box in the web application and their number varies.

For the moment, I creates the maximum I can and hides some of them using a condition.

Romuald.

hiding is best way now, however in java it is possible.
i am using array with positions and if it is visible.
