Hi all,I wonder if there is a way in CoDeSys 2 or 3 to create / modify visualizations from the PLC program. I know, that there is a way to assign names to some of the elements, but I wonder if there is a way to create, configure and show elements from the program itself (a similar way to windows forms - in the background there is always a - generated - code).I have seen some topics in this issue, but the picture is not clear yet. As far as I know, V3 has major improvements in this area. Where is it documented? Thanks in advance,P.Peter

Try it with an exported file and then change it.look for the word visualisation and all variables you can find here.
