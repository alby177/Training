Hello,Is there a way to avoid using the Visualization designer and dynamically create visual content like rectangles, buttons, or images? I want to have a lot of similar elements (probably in the future the number will depend on a config file), but creating them one by one for the worst case scenario and hide the unnecessary seems very tedious and overkill.Maybe a placeholder can be created on the visu and then somehow instantiated and configured several times by code?Thanks in advance,Miguel.

Hi,this is not possible... no plans to implement it at the moment.All objects should exist, but could be hidden and appear if needed.BREdwin

Oh, that's a pity. I guess I will have to do all the manual work then...Thanks!Miguel.
