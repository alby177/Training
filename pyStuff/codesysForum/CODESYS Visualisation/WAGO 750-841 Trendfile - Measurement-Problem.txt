Hi !

(First: sry for my bad english)

I'm using a WAGO controller 750-841 with a barometer.
Every 10 seconds it measures the air pressure and adds the value in a diagram (trend).
Unfortunately the measurement doesn't work when there is activated a trend-file on the WAGO.
The value is just 0 but a file is written (i checked via ftp).

(Hope you understand what I mean; it's hard to explain when you use a german version of CoDeSys...)

Maybe somebody knows the problem and can help me. Thank you!

I am amazed nobody has replied to this!

I am also having huge anominalies with trend in a visualisation, including total PLC lockup.  There seems no logic behind this.  Sometimes it works, sometimes it crashes, sometimes it does not work at all.

I also using a Wago (758-870) so it could be a Wago issue or a CoDeSys issue.  I am working through it at the moment and if I find the answers I will reply again.

Hi,
I have same problem with a wago 750-849

When i set an trend (in my case measure of external temperature), the graph still empty when running and visual by web view, even if i wait 1 hours for refresh of the trend

On the other hand, when connected via codesys software (not in simulation mode), i open this view and datas lines are presents ?

A bug ? a specific parameter to set i forget ?

Ps: option data are stored online and not on a file. hope it is ok.

Any others experiences with wago and trend to share with us ?
