HelloI am working with trends, the question is, can I call the data for a spesific day?  I can go to the data recorded with the arrows, but I want to like make a window and call the spesific day, I dont know if it si possible,  I hope my english can be readed right Â¡thanks

do not rely on this trend, just save your data in a PC as this TREND is not perfect.and yes that is possible as the data is saved in a base and you can set the beginning and end.
