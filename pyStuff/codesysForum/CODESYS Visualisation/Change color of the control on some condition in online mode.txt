I want to change the color of a object when some conditions are true. I would like to know where to actually write the expression for that condition in my visualisation object.
for eg.
 if a variable value is greater than say 100 i want the the oject to change its color say red and wen the variable is less than 100 the object changes back to its original color.

looking forward for some reply.

Hi

1) Select a color for normal mode (Page 'Colors') and for 'Alarm' mode.
2) Write your expression in 'Variables' 'Change color'
For example: PLC_PRG.iX1 > 100
