How can i know which of the visualization's are active at any time in my Plc program?Regards

If you check "Use CurrentVisu variable" in Visualization managers settings, you can use this variable.With this you can :- read the name of the visualiszation page shown into the variable VisuElems.CurrentVisu- show, by program, the visualization page which name is (for example) Visu1 by writing VisuElems.CurrentVisu:= 'Visu1';Please read help called Core_Visualization.Best regards 

I need to know the active visualizatios in a multiclient visu without use the CurrentVisu option.Any help?

I'd also be interested in a simple way. One thing I was looking into is adding code which invoked on the entry to each screen which writes a value into a global variable.I don't want to do 50+ string comparisons each scan, or at least a check for change followed by all the comparisons... A much simpler case statement driven by a global integer would be preferable.

Hi,there will an application example to the CODESYS Store.Maybe this helps meanwhile.BREdwin
