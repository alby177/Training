Hi, 
i am new to codesys and presently i am working on a project where i need to develop some visualisations using codesys without any PLC Code and using CAN network directly. i want to know after developing visualisations how can i run them on the target system(touch screen installed with codesys) in runtime as in what files i need to copy on my target system.

Any help or ideas would be appreciated. 

Best regards, 
Rajat Bansal
