Recently, I configured a alarm table in the codesys visualization and also in the webvisualization. I have noticed that the Acknowledge Selection, Acknowledge all and history button display in German language on the codesys webVisualization but these button show in English language on the codesys visualization.  

My question is how to I configure to those button to be display in English language on codesys webVisualization? (Both attached picture above is belong to the same project file.) How can them be displayed in two different language?..please advise??

HiI am experiencing the same problem. When the visualisation is on a web page /java applet the language on the buttons changes from english to german. Can not find any solution to this probelm.Has anybody a fix for this?
