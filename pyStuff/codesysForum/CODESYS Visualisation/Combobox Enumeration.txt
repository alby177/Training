I have a text-list with IDs and string values:ID      Value0        Nothing1        A2        B3        C    I have a combo box that's referencing a defined enumeration (i.e. A is 1, B is 2, C is 3, etc). However, when I drop in a combobox into visualization and reference the enumeration, I see the IDs (1, 2, 3, etc) instead of the string values (A, B, C, etc). I get the same result even if I change the text-list to use enumeration "test" and reference it from combobox:ID             Value0               Nothingtest.A        Atest.B        Btest.C        C   Maybe I'm doing something wrong?Thanks,
