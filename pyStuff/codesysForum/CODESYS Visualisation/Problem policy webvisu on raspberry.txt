I try to do the GUI part with a raspberry and am having a handwriting font problem.the raspberry runs Raspbian and Ice weasel ( firefox ) .t it is a solution to have the same font on windows ?

hello,You need the same fontâ€™s which you have specified in the CODESYS IDE.So please try to install the missing fonts on your Raspberry PI by sudo apt-get install  ttf-mscorefonts-installer https://packages.debian.org/search?sear ... -installer
