When adding a Bitmap in PLC_Visu, it works but the dimension and resolution change and it need modified in design time, en time on visualization is very slow  (IE7 & FFox).

Any ideas ?

it uses java too
and yes first time is very slow. as it has to send all data to your pc.
start in left top of screen and in the plc tell the resolution.
i use full screen mode from command line and i do not see all the ie crap.
