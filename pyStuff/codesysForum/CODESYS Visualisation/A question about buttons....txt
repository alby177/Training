1) is there a way of determining which button on a visualisation has been clicked by the user (kinda like the 'this' reference in C/C#?)2) when assigning a variable to the input->toggle variable field, does it HAVE to be a boolean?  Or can it be any variable that uses true/false values?  The bits in a dword, for instance?Thanks.Elric

1) is there a way of determining which button on a visualisation has been clicked by the user (kinda like the 'this' reference in C/C#?)I think that the answer is no, but I do not pretend to know everything !      2) when assigning a variable to the input->toggle variable field, does it HAVE to be a boolean? Or can it be any variable that uses true/false values? The bits in a dword, for instance?The variable must be a boolean, but you ca use a bit from a word, dword, int, ...For exemple, if you declare :Value1:INT;You can use Value1.0 witch is the first bit of this variable (You can use from Value1.0 to Value1.15) 

1: yes you can in several waysyou can use toggle and tap for simple inputsor if you use the vis.lib then you can even see if the mouse is hovering above a button (to give it a color or even switch to another vis)2: yes it must be a boolean, however you can use this boolean in a SEL to change from real value.In the util.lib is a function to put a lot boolean into one word.

Thanks for getting back to me on this.The whole value.0 thing was EXACTLY what I had in mind when I asked this question, so I'm glad it worked when I tried it yesterday.    Regarding the "determining-which-button-had-been-pressed" query, what I meant was, when the user clicks on a button, how does codesys know what button you've pressed, and is there a way for the programmer to access that information?  I know about the programmability and the toggle/tap options, but I don't much like the idea of declaring and polling a bunch of variables just to see which button was pressed....Or is that the only way TO do it....?

yes its the only way, Only by having an active display (SCADA program) you can have a workaround.

Ah right.  Thanks for all of your help.

Ok, one more thing:  is there some kind of limit regarding the number of controls one can have on a visualisation?And more to the point, is there a limit on the number of VisualObjectType variables you can have in your program?Reason why I'm asking is because I need quite a few(one for each button, and there are 64 buttons), but when I to assign each button its own VisualObjectType and then try to run the code after compiling, the visualisation does not display like it should (lack of memory?).But when I only set up 1 button with an VOT it works fine... :SOh, and I'm using a Wago 750 881, if that matters at all.Thanks.Elric

64 buttons should not be a big problem.did you switch on webvisualisation?In simulation it will be slow, however in the wago loaded it should be working good.Please use the placeholdermake a vis for one button as a separate vis.then on a workscreen, use a visualisation, next to it use same vis again,now you can use these placeholders with $ signs.then set up a array with items you like to change like button.color or button.tap etc.in button 1 you say $button$ is button1 for 2 you say button2 etc.if you have 8 machines with 8 buttons  do $machine1$ $button1$ etc.each button must have its own name and yes after loading it takes time before the screen is built.If not clear send me a design and a program for it, and i will make a start for you.

Yeah I tried the web visualisation.  Still the same outcome. Thanks for the advice.  I'll look into placeholders (never used them before) and hopefully that'll help with things.Elric

send the .pro file to me and i will have a look.
