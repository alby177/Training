I have a question regarding touch screens with respect to CoDeSys, 
Is it possible to set up CoDeSys to a Touch Screen PLC so that when it loads up, it automatically loads up with the visualisations as the main screen. 

I guess the question should be re-worded to:
Can I make a user friendly GUI out of a set of visualisations on a touch screen PLC?

Thanks

answer is simple YES
the first one should be PLC_VISU

Shooter is correct but I am confused if you mean you are running SoftPLC on a touch screen or you mean you have CoDeSys installed on a computer / PLC that has a touch screen. Those are two different animals.
