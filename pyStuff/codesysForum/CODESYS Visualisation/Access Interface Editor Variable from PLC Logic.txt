Hi,I would like to know if there is a way to access Interface Editor variables from the PLC Logic. I need this because i'm creating standard frames for compose the HMI and in those frames i ask for some variables from the interface editor for the text of some components such as textbox of button text. The problem is that i want to implement multilanguage and other types of text elaboration features, but i need to be able to set those variables from PLC Logic.Someone can help?Thanksaf

Hi,Do you use the visualization inside the PLC? In that case you can simply use global variables in order to access from both sides (Visualization and automation).Otherwise you have to set a Dataserver communication between the devices.If this is not the answer you are looking for, please provide a concrete example on what you want to do.Best regards,Massimo
