Hi,Is it possible to write to a variable of type TIME without converting.If I use a rectangle with %d, it will display 1000 (meaning T#1S).But if I try to write to it, it does not work.I would like to be able to write 2000 and then my variable would be set to T#2S.I know I can do it by converting in the program but I was thinking that if it can read correctly it would be possible to write also.Thank you.

Is this possible or not?

I believe you have to enter T#2000ms or T#2s. Just like you have it in the code. I always just convert a number to time in the code.

For example, enter your time value in seconds in real type (%.1f) on HMI. Lets say 1.5s.  Then on the program side you have to make conversion to type TIME:  tTime := REAL_TO_TIME ( fTime * 1000). Code turns given time value (1.5s) in real type to time format t#1500ms...

Hi,attached an example:BREdwin
