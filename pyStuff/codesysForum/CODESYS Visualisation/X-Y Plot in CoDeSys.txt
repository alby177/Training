I've tried looking at the trend control for XY plot (not X-t)(but it does not seem to be able to handle an XY plot). My version (v2.3) has a combo box for selecting curve type but it is disabled with X/t greyed out in the text area. 
I want to see 2 positions X axis one position and Y axis second position

Can somebody help me?

Best regards

Leonard

It is not possible to do an XY-plot with the trend module. The only way to make a XY-plot is to use an activeX component or draw it with lines.
