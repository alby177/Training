Hi,I have made a project with visualisations with a resolution of 2560 x 1024.I have two monitors, both resolution 1280 x 1024Now I want to run Codesys HMI and show my visualisation entirely on both screens. I wonder how I can do this? Can anybody help me?thank you!Nico.

this is completely dependent of your graphics card and driver not from any 3s software.go to your settings of the videoscreen like intel graphics adapter.
