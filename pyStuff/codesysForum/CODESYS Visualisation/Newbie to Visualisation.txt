I'm using CoDeSys 2.3.9.13 and I have created a few visu pages in a project. I want to add a background bitmap to these pages, but nothing appears when I go to Extas | Select background bitmap... and select the bmp. I have also tried this on a new page with the same results. Could someone point out what I need to do please?Thanks.

it is not a background but a same as bitmap so you must tell it a size.

Thank you for your response. I apologize for my ignorance, but I do not understand what you mean that it is not a background when the key I press indicates I am selecting a background. Also, I do not see how to give it a size. Am I using the wrong menu selection or is this a command line operation? Thanks.

in settings you have to check in frame the include background map.do you see it when making?as in the vis it will need to be send to the client you wil have to put this on otherwise it is not send to the display.in simulation however it does work as it is on same computer.but in real it will need to be send with the file, you can see this while sending the program to your PLC.

Shooter,In settings the include background map was already checked and I do not see the background image when I am making the page. I just tried starting out with a new project: Wago 750-841 PLC and all default target settings except I checked the "Web Visualization" box under the Visualization tab. I accepted the default Ladder Program object for PLC_PRG and left it blank. I then went to the Visualization register and added a PLC_Visu object. Next I...1. checked the settings in the 'Extra' menu and to be sure the "Include background bitmap" box was checked in the Frame category.2. With PLC_Visu object selected I went to Extras|Select a background bitmap and selected a .bmp file.3. Nothing appeared on the page!I do not have to have a background image in this project, but at this point of my Visualiztion learning curve (right now like the North Wall on Mt. Everest  ) I feel I should find out what I am doing incorrectly. I am also thinking that it would behoove me to read the Visualization User Guide thoroughly - something I haven't done yet.   Thank you very much for your help.

with me it works so again now with an example.also explaining visu in visu (not reaaly needed here but easier to scale etc.i do work a lot with visu in visu so i do only one change in the visu and a lot of changes can be made.check out placeholders.(works only if you have two or more visus with same name in one screen.now you only need to make one screen for a lot of fans for example.

Hi Shooter,Thank you for the example and the suggestion to check out placeholders. As I played with the example, trying different combinations, I found it to be very instructive and helpful in 'sparking' my imagination on how I might incorporate the technique in the future. The placeholders...Wow, pretty powerful.   I use CitectSCADA quite a bit and using the placeholders reminds me of functionality that I am already familiar with. It really helps to have a path to focus on when faced with an initial learning curve (i.e. concentrating on individual 'trees' instead of trying to take in the whole 'forest' at once). You are a great help Shooter and I appreciate that. AND...as an extra added bonus I found out why I am not seeing background images!   While I was working with your example I decided to try and use the codesys.bmp as a background image and, lo and behold, there it was!! Long story short - the bitmap I was trying to use for a background image is in a desktop folder. Apparently CoDeSys cannot get a "static file reference" from the desktop, which does actually seems reasonable to me now that I think about it. Thanks again - I think I will go play with placeholders for a while!  Be Well,Steve
