I want to know if it would be possible to see videos in visualization(for example a webcam).And another question is about the bitmaps elements. I have imported several bitmaps and .jpegs and the quality of the image decreases considerably. Is there any solution for that in this version??? Viele danke.

You can put activeX controls on visualizations. I haven't done this but if your video had an activeX control I think it may be possible.
