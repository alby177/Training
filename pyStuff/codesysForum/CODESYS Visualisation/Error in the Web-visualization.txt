Hello everybody,

I have a one question.
When I connected in the Webserver (using <address of the webserver>:<port of the webserver>/webvisu.htm), following dialog is opened.

"File webvisu.htm requested"

But the file(webvisu.htm) is already exist in directory "visu".

What should I do?

Hi, I have same problem.
