I have an application that uses Visualization on a Windows CE 6.0 platform. I want to keep a certain resolution across different screen sizes. Can the "Best Fit in Online Mode" option be set in the target CE device? I can set this up on my PC that I am doing the development on and it works great for displaying the visualization correctly on my PC, but I cannot find a way to do this same thing on the CE device.

- For a "Certain Resolution", you must find in the PLC after downloading the program, the "Webvisu.htm" file.(this is taken from the Wago Perspecto 762 manual)        On the WEBVISU.htm page, the resolution parameter must be changed from the relative value in percent to the fixed value in pixels.          Example:          Web Panel resolution: 320 x 240 pixel.          <APPLET CODEBASE=. CODE=webvisu/WebVisu.class name="WebVisu" width="99%" height="99%" id="webvisuapplet">          Adjust the parameters as follows.          <APPLET CODEBASE=. CODE=webvisu/WebVisu.class name="WebVisu" width="320" height="240" id="webvisuapplet"> They only change the width and height from a % to size in pixels.- For an automatic Fit depending the resolution: I think can be possible to read the screen size in that same htm file, and add the pixel values dynamically, but I have no idea how that can be made
