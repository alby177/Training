Hi,in Codesys 2.3 it's possible to use placeholders in visu elements configuration, that is to define a variable like thisDrive_$x$.StartThen if we specify that x should be 5 for a specific visu, the above becomes Drive_5.StartIs it possible to do the same in v.3.5.x ? I can't see it anywhere.Thanks

HelloEach visualization page has an interface (like FB) on witch you can define variables.To do this select the command Visualization âž”  Interface editor Uses this variables to set your animation on the visualization.When you place this visualization like a frame, you can acces this variables by reference properties and affect the value or the variables from your application.You have to read the Help file "CODESYS Visualisation", chapter "Creating a Structured User Interface", su chapter "Calling Visualization with Interface".Best regard
