Hello everybodyI'm working on a simple project with Codesys on Raspberry pi 3.I have created, with web visualization, a switch that turn on and off a LED and all work fine.I would know if it's possibile to use the web visualization when the raspberry doesn't have an internet connection.If I close Codesys Software on the PC, the program on Raspberry does not stop, but if I disconnect the raspberry wi-fi the program immediatly stopped. I have use this IP addres for visualization on browser: 192.168.18:8080/webviso.htmI need to use the web visualization whitout internet conncetion. Is it possibile?Are there other ways to do this?Thankyou    

Hi,this is an error, should be possible to use webvisu via localhostbut at the .oment it does not work.Need to be fixed.Maybe it is woth to check if a tap or tun device will workaround this you could give this a try.BREdwin

There are other ways to have this webvisu, mybe on a window that isn't the browser?There is a way to contact the developers and ask them to resolve the problem?Not a good situation for me   Thankyou

Hi,>There are other ways to have this webvisu, mybe on a window that isn't the browser?no... i just want so say. I have no time at the moment to search for a workaround, I try to motivate you to search a workaround by using a tap device, no glue if this is possible.>There is a way to contact the developers and ask them to resolve the problem?hm.. does not really help, error is tracked but with low priority at the moment.. so i see not date when it will be fixed.Plan B:my question is: If you use a PI3 ... is it possible to have to act as dummy hotspot to have a valid IP... then it will workBREdwin
