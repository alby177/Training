Hi all,I am working on my masterthesis and they dont want to spent money to buy software and tools. I am looking for a way for webvisualisation of my system. I am using Codesys IFM V2.3.For example in Labview there is an Internet Toolkit includes CGI Vls that you can use to build and execute CGI applications. Is there such a free way for Codeys? Do you have any idea?Bests,mmt

in codesys is a free webvisualisation available.oke it runs only two hours when used from machine, but maybe this is enough.

get yourself codesys from the website codesys.comor use the ifm (not sure if vis is build in)use as target your ifm.make your project and make a vis in same project.it will run from within the ifm, however if you keep the programming open you can see the vis without any other communication.if ifm has ethernet you can make a vis for any PC.
