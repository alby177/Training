Hi all,I use CODESYS in domotic application, and it's necessary that the transfer between PLC server and targets (PCs, smartphones, _ etc.) be as fast as possible.If I use CODESYS WEBVISU, the visu application is installed on the PLC server. When I connect with a device remotely (with a smartphone, _, etc.) the response times are long because the web page must be transferred from the PLC to the device.Based on the above, my question is: is it possible, with CODESYS, to create an application integrated in the device (integrated, for example, in smartphone device) and transfer, between PLC and device, only the data with JSON utility?Thanks!
