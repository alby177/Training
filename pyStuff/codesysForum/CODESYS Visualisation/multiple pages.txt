dont update as a newer version will not be better and the windows CE version will not be able to run newer java.as in manual, when all pages are used once they stay in stack so they can be called faster.a BMP is very slow first time, after once called it is done from within the HMI.as in the manual it says this unit is to be used for simple screens.and yes in simulation it is mighty fast as no download is needed.you can tell codesys to download the pages to the HMI on start (it will take several minutes before a start.
