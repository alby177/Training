I am using Codesys 3.5.7 for Wago (aka: e!Cockpit). I need to change the visualization within a frame using structured text, but only on the current client. Since the code is embedded in a button, I assumed the button would have a pointer to the client it is displayed on and have tried to access it via:Code:pClientData := THIS^._pCurrentClientData;Â  // unless I'm mistaken, THIS should point to the current button, or at least the current visualizationorCode:iClientIndex := VisuElems.g_ClientManager.GetClientId(THIS^._pCurrentClientData);pClientData := VisuElems.g_ClientManager.GetClientData(iClientIndex);In both examples, it fails to compile with: Cannot convert type 'Unknown Type: 'THIS^._pCurrentClientData'' to type 'POINTER TO VisuStructClientData'.I have checked the following example projects: Client Independent Visualization Switching, Visualization Switching, and Responsive Design. None of these give any example on how to determine what the current visualization is.Also, does anyone know if there is a way to create client specific variables? I know if I can get an index for the current client I can simply use an array of variables, just wondering if there is a simpler way?Thank you in advance.
