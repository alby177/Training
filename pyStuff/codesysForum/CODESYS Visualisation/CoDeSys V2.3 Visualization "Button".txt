Hi

How to change the color for "Button". In CoDeSys V2.3 (Visualization) tool
"Color Change" option is disabled.
Please let me know if anybody knows.

Idea n°1 :

VAR_GLOBAL
     Bool1:BOOL;
     Color1:DWORD;
END_VAR

PROGRAM
IF Bool1 THEN
     Color1:=16#00808080;
ELSE
     Color1:=16#00FF0000;
END_IF;

Configuration of the button :
Category Input : Toggle variable : .Bool1
Category Colorvariables : Fill Color : .Color1


Idea n°2 :
Use a rectangle instead of a button, You will lose the draft of the button on the click but the color change is easier to configure !


J hope this can help you

I think what you are asking is directly from the button itself, during design time. Try this.

A button is on the screen for a user event so set the variable that you want to toggle under CATEGORY-INPUT, Check toggle variable and place a boolean in the variable entry box. Now when ever that variable is TRUE the color variable under CATEGORY-COLORVARIABLES-FILL COLOR ALARM will be used.

CATEGORY-COLORVARIABLES-FILL COLOR is changing the default gray color to a color of your choice when there is no alarm and no alarm fill color selected.

So if you tie the toggle variable to PLC_PRG.a, and set FILL COLOR ALARM to 16#0000FF00 the button will fill completely green when ever a := TRUE;

If you want to set the button frame color then that is found and selected under CATEGORY-BITMAP-ALARM COLOR.

I use this sometimes because the CoDeSys button is very hard to tell that it is actually depressed so I color it to exaggerate the alarm.
