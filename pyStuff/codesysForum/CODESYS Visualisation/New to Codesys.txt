Hello All,

I am new to Codesys so please pardon my ignorance.

If I have the project file for a controller, how do I use the visualization component of Codesys to view the status of inputs and outputs of the PLC when it is running?

Thank you in advance for your time.

Online - Login. Once CoDeSys establishes a communication connection you now have access to all the information. Go to the visu screens and open them you will see the data is populated automatically.
