Hi all,I am trying to configure a PC that will run my HMI application. How can I install only the HMI without install the entire CODESYS platform?Thank you, regards.Massimo

In the CODESYS store you can find the CODESYS HMI SL. When you download this, you get the installer.

Ok, thank you.Regards.Massimo
