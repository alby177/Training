Hi There fellow codesys propeller heads...I really enjoy using the codesys tool.  However the visualiation tool is fairly basic looking and a little limited.  I was wondering where or how i could create my own buttons icons and graphical elements, for example machine parts that have configurable porperties like colour changes and motions, maybe a part moving on the conveyor or a motor running etc.  and then import them in as libraries.Any ideas, i am sure there is a lot of really smart people in this community that may have the answers here.  if so please let me know.Thanks, Russell

Have a look at the Advanced HMI project at SouceForgehttp://sourceforge.net/projects/advancedhmi/The graphics there are very nice looking.  I don't believe they have a driver for CoDeSys but as a SourceForge project, maybe you could help write one Other tools I have used in the past for making my own graphics are inkscape http://inkscape.org/ which is a vector graphics freeware program similar to Illustrator or CorelDrawand Paint.net which is a freeware bitmap editor like photoshop.

Thanks Norm,The graphics there do look good.  So i guess that my question really has two parts.1) How do you drop vector graphics into CoDeSys HMI 2) How do you create things like buttons, meters, dials etc and save them as library components for use in many projects and sharing with colleauges.

But If you create your graphics in a vector program, you can export them at any resolution for the best look on the device you are using.  WMF is one of the graphic types but I haven't been able to get it to work with images layered on top of one another..Russell wrote:2) How do you create things like buttons, meters, dials etc and save them as library components for use in many projects and sharing with colleauges.There you are on your own again.  This is the reason many people prefer to use standard HMI devices which usually have their own software with libraries of the most used things for industrial control.

There has to be a way!!!

"2) How do you create things like buttons, meters, dials etc and save them as library components for use in many projects and sharing with colleauges."You can create your own libraries. In a library there may be code, variables, and visualization, or only one of those things. In a visualization you can have only one object (button, valve, ...) and it will be reusable and configurable if you use "placeholder".See the online help : CoDeSys vizusualisation -> Visualization elements, Configure ... -> Placeholder.At each location in the configuration dialog at which variables or text are entered, a placeholder can be set in place of the respective variable or text. Any string enclosed in two dollar signs ($) is a valid placeholder (e.g. $variable1$, variable$x$). ... The various objects are then placed in a visualization page like visualization and placeholders and are then replaced by the variables of the current project.But for _ designs, use your favorite drawing tool : paint, Gimp, ... the list is very long  

Thanks for that I'll give some of it a try. I think what I am asking needs to be done in some kind of compiler environment. What I am asking is how do you create an object and have a pop window behind it for entering the properties?
