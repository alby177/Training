What I'm trying to do is use bitmaps as buttons in a visualization for navigation. When the user presses a button the bitmap should change to a different image that makes it look like the button is being pressed. Then after the button is selected and the application has navigated to a different screen, the bitmap should be a different image to show the current page we're on.I'm used to creating UI's where there is some sort of event driven feature to use in order to do what I'm trying. CoDeSys seems to have this Bitmap variable to configure, but I cannot seem to figure it out despite the documentation.I've read the help on the subject, where it suggests using the CASE statement, but do not know what the nId variable is referring to. I noticed the Programmability tab and tried a few different things in there, but no luck.Are there any tutorials showing how to setup a bitmap to use different bitmaps? Has anyone done something similar?

I figured out a way to do it (whether or not it is the best, I doubt).1. I create a [var]:STRING for each bitmap.2. I create a [var]:STRING for each button.3. I configure the Bitmap variable to be the var in step 2.4. I configure the Execute program to "INTERN ASSIGN bHome:=([INSERT A BITMAP VAR]);INTERN ASSIGN bSpare:=([INSERT A BITMAP VAR])"This implementation does not handle the button press (equivalent of mouse down).I created this topic, because I had been receiving an error:Code:Error 4001: __PLC_VISUE_CYCLECODE(6): Identifier 'DRAWBITMAPBYSTRING' not definedAs it turns out, it appears to be a target specific error. I tested this method out on a Target none and had no problems, as well as an ifm CR0032. When I switched to a ccPilot target, that is when the error pops up.

easier is to have two buttons on top of each other and make them invisible.it just changes the color and there is no need to load the bitmap each time.you also can change the color etc.this will work in java so also on html visualisations.
