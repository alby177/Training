Hello,I am currently developing an application with PMX and Codesys, consisting on an interface to show the measurements of two sensors connected to the PMX.Web visualization was working well since the beggining, but suddenly, I don't know the reason (maybe due to I changed something in the configuration of the PMX software), when I try to connect to Online mode Codesys displays the following message: "Invalid service structure" , and there is no possibility to visualize the application in Codesys software, neither to run it via web browse with webvisu.htm.Can you help me? I would appreciate your prompt response, I am in a hurry to release this application   . Thanks in advance to everyone.
