Please redact openDialog function must be:FOR i:=-1 TO 15 DO	IF GVL.g_pData[i]<>0 AND_THEN GVL.g_ive[i]<>0 THEN		IF NOT (GVL.g_pData[i]^.GlobalData.GlobalClientID=i)THEN			GVL.g_pData[i]:=0;			GVL.init[i]:=FALSE;			GVL.g_aClientIds[i]:=FALSE;			GVL.g_ive[i]:=ive;		END_IF		IF GVL.g_aClientIds[i] THEN			CONTINUE;		END_IF			GVL.g_aClientIds[i]:=TRUE;		__TRY			NewStDialog(GVL.g_pData[i],GVL.g_ive[i],'ST Dialog','Hi!',0,0);		__CATCH(exc)			__ENDTRY	END_IFEND_FOR
