Hi  I'm a new learner of CODESYS and I just tried to add an interface for my PLC program. I followed the tutorial of V2.3 and it told me to create a visualization with the name 'PLC_VISU' and it will be automatically shown. I did it even with System variable 'CurrentVisu' defined inside.I set this variable with PLC_VISU and no matter how I tried, there is no visualization on PLC screen. BTW, in target-setting the CurrentVisu is activated. The PLC configuration is correct.Is anybody know why? It has been bothered me over one week. Any suggestions would be appreciated.  Thank you.SOLVED:SET PLC_Configuration->GraphicInterface->Module parameters->ComPort: COM1(from disable)
