Hello,
I think it will be a good idee to list the differences between standard visualization and webvisualizations the user's find.
(see my other 2 messsages)

I really want to use webvisu but it doesn't work like the standard visualisation.
Each time I spent more time to fix the problem.

This morning I find the following problem:

I have a visualization called COM2 for a rs232 communication port.
CoDeSys doesn't create the com2.xml file in the compile directory. I get a message when I use the "online login":

The file ...\COM2.xml could not be sent!

I renane my visualization file COM_2 and everything look nice.
There is probably some reserved keywords ?
