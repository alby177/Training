Hello friends. I want to test my sample project using PLCWinNT.exe. 
The target which I am using is "CCP XS 10 inch screen simulated". 
Is it possible to test this target using PLCWinNT? 
If it is then how to test and if not which 3S Codesys target is to be used just for the sake of testing. 
Cheers & regards,
