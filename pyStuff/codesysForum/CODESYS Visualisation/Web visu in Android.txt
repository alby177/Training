What do i have to do if i want to show a Web Visualization on an Android platform.

I think you just need the right Java installed and you should be good.  And, of course, the ability to connect to the device through an IP address.

I think some installations also require you to type in the port address on the URL such as http:\\192.168.119.200:8080/webvisu.htm
