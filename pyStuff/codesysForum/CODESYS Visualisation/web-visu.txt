Hello,Is there a variable for Web-Visualization which is like CurrentVisu in Target Visu?  I am running a test function and I need to it kill the test if the user leaves the screen.:~Kind regards,Doug

the answer is Noask roland if there is a way to see if info is asked by the PC and if so the unit is active, if not then is there a variable no need to update..

Thank you for your input.  It actually makes sense that it would be able to pass the variable back since multiple users can be logged into the web-visu at a single time.Kind regards,Doug
