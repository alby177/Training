Hello!I apoligize asking the same thing i asked before in the german forum, but maybe i get more response here. Is it possible to influece the List of referenced visualisations for a frame programmatically OR to set the actual visualisation for a frame (which isnt listed as referenced visualisation) by a string?Background is, my application has many different "Functions" each one with his own visualisation. The user can arrange those "Functions" in a grid-layout by his own requirements. Because there are many different layouts (different count of blocks, screen ratio) there will be many frames (approx. 100 by now) which i have to edit, when a new function is introduced or a function is deleted. This is a pretty boring and error-prone task.Isnt it possible to switch the vis for a frame in the way i can do this for VisuElems.CURRENTVISU:='an_available_visu' ?And if this is possible, how do i reference a frame element? I tried some assignments like: visuname.elementname := 'visuname'   but all of that does not work.Soory, im a codesys noob but hope that someone can help.Regards
