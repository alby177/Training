Hi Guys,
I have a few simple bitmaps (like icons) that I wish to angular rotate about their centres under program control using the VisualObjectType structure.  They do not seem to work yet standard objects created within the Visual programming environment do.

Is there an exception to this for bitmaps?

Hi,

I don't think  it's possible to rotate bitmaps in the visualization.

One solution would be to create a series of bitmaps with the icon rotated at a different angle in each one. Then use the programmability possibility in CoDeSys to select the one that should be displayed.

Best regards,
Kristian Berlin

Kristian is right you can't rotate a bitmap.
