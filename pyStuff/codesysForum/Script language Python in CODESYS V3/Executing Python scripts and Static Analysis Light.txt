Hi,I'm wondering if anyone knows if it's possible to turn on the Static Analysis Light options (available in the IDE when editing Project Settings) via Python.  I'd like to be able to execute a script that changes the Static Analysis Light options for a project.  Any time and information or thoughts anyone has would be great!  Thanks very much!
