Hi feragfh6.Code:project.save_as_compiled_library(destination_name)Save the current project as a compiled library. (This command currently only works for the primary project.)Note:The destination_name has the following semantics: If it is omitted or the empty string, the full project path will be used, with the extension changed to ”.compiled_library”. If the name of an existing directory is given, the library will be saved there, using the project base name and the extension changed to ”.compiled_library”. Otherwise, the destination name will be interpreted as the path relative to where the current project is.BRMartin
