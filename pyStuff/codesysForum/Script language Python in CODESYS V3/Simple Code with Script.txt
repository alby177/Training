Hello!Is it possible to write a simple Codefragment, something like "count := count + 1; etc.. " including creating the variable count over a Python Script?I already have written a script which creates a POU (ST), but i can not find any topics about writing an application over a script.Regards!

You have to use textual_implementation and textual_declaration properties of IScriptTextDocument.There are few methods like replace, insert, append and so on (see ScriptEngine.chm for more information).Code:proj = projects.primaryfound = proj.find("Application", True)app = found[0]# Create FBmypou = app.create_pou("MyPou")# Change declaration of the FBimplementation = mypou.textual_declaration.replace("""FUNCTION_BLOCK MyPouVAR_INPUT   iValue : INT;END_VARVAR_OUTPUTEND_VARVAREND_VAR""")# Change implementation of the FBmypou.textual_implementation.replace("""iValue := iValue + 1;""")# Add method to FBdosomething = mypou.create_method("DoSomething", "INT")# Change declaration of the methoddosomething.textual_declaration.replace("""METHOD DoSomething : INTVAR_INPUT   iVal1 : INT;   iVal2 : INT;END_VAR""")# Change implementation of the methoddosomething.textual_implementation.replace("""DoSomething := iVal1 + iVal2;""")# Find the pou and delete itfound = app.find("MyPou")if found and len(found) == 1:   found[0].remove()else:   print("POU 'MyPou' was not found"
