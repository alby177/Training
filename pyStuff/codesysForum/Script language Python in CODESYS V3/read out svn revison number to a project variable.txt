I am not using the Codesys svn.I'm not sure which svn Revision number you want to read.If it's about projects or objects within a project which is connected via CODESYS SVN, then I think using the CODESYS SVN AddOn is the only way to do it, it provides an SVN_VERSION_INFO object where you can read the project revision number - but this SVN_VERSION_INFO is only available when the SVN AddOn is installed and active (because it cannot be guaranteed to be up to date when no SVN Plugin is there).There are three special cases, however:Compiled libraries contain the SVN_VERSION_INFO when the SVN Plugin was active during library compilation.Interface libraries never contain the SVN_VERSION_INFO (because constants are not allowed to change, so there's no way to change the revision number in an updated version of the interface library). On the other hand, as interface libraries are strictly upwards compatible, the exact revision should make no difference.Non-compiled libraries which are referenced by the primary project  do not contain the SVN_VERSION_INFO - this is a known limitation wich will be fixed eventually: SVN-188
