(CoDeSys version: SP9)The API for managing gateways and scanning the network was introduced with CODESYS V3.5 SP8.Here some example code:Code:# Find device objectfound = projects.primary.find('Device', False)assert(found and len(found) == 1, 'No or more than one device found')dev = found[0]# Find gatewaygw = online.gateways['Gateway-1']# Scan networktargets = gw.perform_network_scan()# Find the target in the result listmatchingTarget = Nonefor target in targets:   print("Name: {} Addr: {}".format(target.device_name, target.address))   if target.device_name == 'KELLERMANB':      matchingTarget = target;      break# Set comm. path of the deviceif matchingTarget:   print('Set communication path of device')   dev.set_gateway_and_device_name(gw, target.device_name)   # or   # dev.set_gateway_and_address(gw, target.address)else:   print('No matching target found')Look for IScriptGateway, IScriptGateways and IScriptScanTargetDescription in the ScriptEngine API documentation.BRMartin
