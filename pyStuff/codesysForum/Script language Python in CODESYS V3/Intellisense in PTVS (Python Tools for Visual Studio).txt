Is it possible to get intellisense in PTVS for the Codesys Objects like "projects" ... ?

Hi,Right now, this is not yet possible (except if you create the files yourself).However, we plan to Implement generating a stub scriptengine.py as part of CDS-23713, which could then be used as a source for intellisense.

Hello,I've looked very thoroughly in both V3.5 SP10 Patch1 and V3.5 SP11 Patch 2 and I just can't find what or where this source for Intellisense for PTVS is. Could you please help me?BR,Wouter

HelloI would also be interested in this.Is it possible to create a (python) project in visual studio, add a scriptengine to the project and use it as every other .NET assembly with intellisense? Or with some other way. The documentation online is just not very helpfull I think, and the link is broken since ages.Thanks for the informations.Greetings
