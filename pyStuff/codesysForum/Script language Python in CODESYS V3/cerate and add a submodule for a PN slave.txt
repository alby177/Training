For slots you use the method plug(...) of the slot object instead of add(...) of the parent device object.BRMartin

Hi Martin,I've got it so far. Thank you for that. But the problem I mentioned i my other thread still exists. After adding everything i go online und run the application. But there are still connection(?) problems....Attachment:fehler3.PNGThen i have to stop and logout, open the et200s treeobject, go online again and it runs.Attachment:geht.PNGI recognized that before i do that, the hostparameter id=1025 Name=slaveoptions is missing...I tried it with disable and enable the device but nothing works... Is there something i can do??Thank youSteffen
