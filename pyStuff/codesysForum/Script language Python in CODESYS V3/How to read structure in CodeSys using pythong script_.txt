Hi all,I have some question about python for CodeSys:1. How can I read all structure without knowledge of fields inside this structure using python?2. Does CodeSys has some alternatives for tkFileDialog library? How can I create some dialog boxes for opening/clothing files?

Read the online value through Monitoring or finding and reading the DUT objects?SashaSasha wrote:2. Does CodeSys has some alternatives for tkFileDialog library? How can I create some dialog boxes for opening/clothing files?Look in the Scripting API documenation for the interface/class IScriptUI which contains methods to open dialogs.Here some example code:Code:print("Now, the user can select files and directories")res = system.ui.open_file_dialog("Choose multiple files:", filter="Text files (*.txt)|*.txt|Image Files(*.BMP;*.JPG;*.GIF)|*.BMP;*.JPG;*.GIF|All files (*.*)|*.*", filter_index = 0, multiselect=True)print("The user did choose: '%s'" % str(res)) # res is a tuple as multiselect is true.BRMartin
