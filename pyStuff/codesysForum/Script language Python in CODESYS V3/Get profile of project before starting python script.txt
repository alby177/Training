Is there any possibility to get/read the profile of a project before we open it with Python?We have different projects made with different version of COEDSYS. For the start of a Python script we have to know the profile "--profile="CoDeSys V3.4 SP3 Patch 1" of the project. How can we read the profile of a saved project?Thanks pavo

The project is basically a zip file, and the profile information is included there (in the files profile.auxiliary). In the header of the file, the profile name is also encoded (in UTF-16, AFAICS). So with some reverse engineering, you could write your own code to parse profile name out of the file header...HTH,Markus
