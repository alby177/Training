Hi,I have explored the CoDeSys API and help file. Also we have used Python introspection on the various interfaces/objects of projects, project, library manager to no avail.I am trying to find API to upgrade/invoke the following: 1. Visualization Profile Version2. Compiler version3. Visualization Style Version4. Build the ProjectAny help would be much appreciated.

Build the ProjectBuilding of the project is currently only implicitly triggered when a login to the device is done. Explicit access to the build commands is currently planned for V3.5 SP2 (Issue CDS-22407). You may use your support contact to add your company as an interested customer in this issue.HTH,Markus Schaber

Hello Markus,Do we have any update as to whether the Build Project API has been incorporated?Thanks.

Hi,The improvement was incorporated into V3.5 SP2:Project objects were extended with the following members: check_all_pool_objects() which works when the current project is a library project, and it resembles the "Check All Pool Objects" command from the "Build" menu. generate_runtime_system_files(string destination_directory, bool generate_m4 = true, bool generate_c = false) to generate the C headers for native libraries. clean_all() to perform a clean_all. save_as_compiled_library(destination)Object objects are now extended with the following members: is_application - property getter which is true when the object is an application.Objects which are Applications now extended with the following members: is_active_application - property to chech whether this application is the active one. build() - build the application. clean() - clean the application. generate_code() - Generates the code for the application. rebuild() - rebuilds the application. create_boot_application(string output_filename) - Creates the offline boot project at the specified outputpath.Users can use the system.get_messages(Guid) and system3.get_message_objects(Guid, Severity) calls to check whether any errors or other compile messages were added.To help the users to find the appropriate messages, system.get_message_categories() and system.get_message_category_description() were added, so they can print all message categories and their guids.

Thanks Markus. This is really useful info.

Hi,If you're still reading: Could you describe the exact use case?Would the possibility to allow an upgrade of those elements to the newest version (in analogy to the "Project Environment" dialog) be enough? (This is already filed as an improvement in our jira database: CDS-34105Or do you really need to explicitly set those versions to arbitrary values via scripting?Thanks,Markus

Yes. The requirement is to upgrade to the newest compatible version via scripting. i.e. set the versions to the newest version/some specific version so that manual upgradation of the versions of tons of project is avoided and can be done easily via. scripting.Best.

Hi,The aforementioned CDS-34105 improvement will allow to upgrade to the newest version during project load, but not to a specific version.Is the possibility to set a specific version really important? And what is the use case?Thanks, Markus
