Hi support team,is it possible to add a POU (e.g. prg_myCalls) call via python script to a dadicated task "task03" within the task configuration?Thanks in advance._

It is requested for CODESYS V3.5 SP10 so maybe it will be released with the SP10 release.If you really need it now, you could export the task configuration with PLCopenXML, change the configuration in the XML and import it.BRMartin

Could you provide me an example for adding and manipulating tasks ?

See screenshot.BRMartin
