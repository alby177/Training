I'm a little new to the scripting interface, so I hope this isn't a dumb question...I'd like to develop a script that creates an image pool in a project and adds a number of images to it, but I haven't been able to find any hooks that would let me do either.  Have I missed something, or is this functionality not available?

Hi, David,Right now, this functionality is not directly available.If you are interested, we can file it in our database, so it will be implemented eventually.There also may be workarounds which could be developed with further investigation.HTH,Marus

OK, thanks for the info.  I'm early on in things and I expect I'll be able find other solutions for what I'm trying to do.  Just figured I'd ask in case I really was missing it.David.

Hi, David,If it always is the same list of images you want to add to the projects, the import_native function could be a possible workaround.HTH,Markus
