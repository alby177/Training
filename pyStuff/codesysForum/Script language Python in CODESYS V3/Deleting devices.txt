Hello all,Does someone know how to delete particular device from project list using script?

Thank You,Also, is there a way to move module in device tree up or down, using script?My devices tree looks like this:- CIFX_PB   - UR20_FBC_PB_DP      - UR20_8DO_P      - UR20_4DO_PI was trying to run script:proj = projects.primaryapp = proj.active_applicationonlineapp = online.create_online_application(app)dev = proj.find("UR20_FBC_PB_DP", True)obj = proj.find("UR20_4DO_P", True)obj[0].move(dev[0],0)but in response I have error: "This device cannot be added or inserted here"

Actually, I did experiment a little bit, and it worked on my side.
