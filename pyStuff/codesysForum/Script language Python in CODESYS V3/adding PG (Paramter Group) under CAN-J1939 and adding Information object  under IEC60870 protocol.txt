Hi support Team,I am try to add PG under CAN-J1939 and Information Objects under IEC 60870 protocol by using Scriping. It is possible with SP9 or SP10? When yes, can you provide some example ? Thanks a lot!

See my post in an other thread.I am not familiar with the second part. What are "Information Objects"?BRMartin

Hi Martin,as my understanding, the Infor. object can be also named as Data-point. In CoDeSys, they can be configured in this way, as shown in attached jpg "Informationobject.jpg".

Hi  Martin,I have do setting as your step-description. An read all the device parameters through Script. (see following jpg. The Detail message can be found in IEC.txt. in point 4.0) There are no new entry found.BR.hhz

The Detail message can be found in IEC.txt. in point 4.0) There are no new entry found.Check the tab "Control station Parameters" of the device editor for any entries.I can only guess but there are two parameters (29 and 30) which are related to the Information objects. Are you also printing the data elements, which are below a device parameters, in your python script?BRMartin
