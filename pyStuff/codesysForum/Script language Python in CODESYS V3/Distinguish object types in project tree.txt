Is it possible to determine the of objects in the project tree while iterating over them?I need to distinguish between POUs and Visualization objects for example.Code:    for child in folderobject.get_children():        if child.is_folder:            print ('Found folder: {}'.format(child.get_name()))            export_folder(child)        else:            print(child.type)child.type() will only return these guid, but from my current understanding i have no way tell what kind of object that is?Thanks in advanceFlorian

Hi FloWil.What's the use case behind your question?Some objects, which are supported by the ScriptEngine, have a special property. For example, the device object has the property "is_device".BRMartin

Yes so i saw the functions for testing for folder and devices. The use case is exporting of the project, but on a per-file basis.I basically need to have one POU/Visualisation in one exported file. This is also why i am not using the recursive export on the project, because it will stop exporting when encountering a subfolder of project. I have this working already for everything code related by using PLCOpenXML-files. Visualisations do not export to PLCOpenXML though at all as it seems?So the idea is to export them seperately in native format.
