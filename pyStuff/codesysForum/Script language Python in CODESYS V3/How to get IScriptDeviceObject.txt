Hi, I'd like to use a method from IScripDeviceObject in a "regular" plugin that does not use ScriptEngine yet. Is there a way to get the IScripDeviceObject from IDeviceObject? (Cast does not work.) Or do I have to use ScriptEngine.Execute? Thanks in advance.

Hi MSprock.Your question should normally be send to our support because it is beyond the scope of this forum. MSprock wrote:the methods are: export/import_io_mappings_from_csvThese two methods of the IScriptDeviceObject are just calling the corresponding command with the necessary arguments.Both commands use the following argument list:- File path of the CSV file- Project handle of the project which contains the device- Object Guid of the device which should import/export its IO mappingBRMartin
