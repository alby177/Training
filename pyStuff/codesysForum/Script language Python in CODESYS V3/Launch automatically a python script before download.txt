Hi all,I need to launch automatically a python script before download the application in the device. Can I perform this operation when the user click on the 'Login' button?I know it is possible to execute a POU via Task Configuration but it seems impossible to run a python scriptThanks,Massimo

Hi Massimo.Massimo.Milluzzo wrote:Hi all,I need to launch automatically a python script before download the application in the device. Can I perform this operation when the user click on the 'Login' button?Sorry, but not at the moment. We have the entry CDS-20898 in our bug tracking but it is not implemented yet. Small parts are already implemented but not the event part you need.One of the already implemented parts could be a solution to your problem. It was introduced with CODESYS V3.5 SP10 (see CDS-48910) and allows the user to execute python scripts from the toolbar. Search the online help for "Calling Scripts via Toolbar Icons". If you use this possibility, you have to do the login in your python script.BRMartin

Hi Martin,Thanks to the reply. I'm already using the button to execute scripts for the toolbar and it is very usefull, my request is connected to the other topic about the GVL variables. I would like to start the script automatically in order to be sure I don't forget it  Do you have an idea about the release plan?Thank you again,Regards.Massimo
