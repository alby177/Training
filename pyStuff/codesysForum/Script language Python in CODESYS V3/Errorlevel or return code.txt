Does CoDeSys return an errorlevel, when using --runscript?I use (in a batch file):Code:"%CoDeSysPath%\CoDeSys.exe" --profile="CoDeSys V3.5 Patch 4" --noUI --runscript="script1.py"echo %errorlevel%The errorlevel is 0 always. Even when using sys.exit (4) in the script.How can I get the return code from the script running in CoDeSys, into my batch file?

By hindsight, the process is still terminated in --noUI mode, so there the exit code should be retained. I filed issue CDS-30366 in our tracker, so this will be fixed eventually.

I replaced Code:sys.exit(4)withCode:system.exit(4)And it is working successful. The batch command retrieves the correct errorlevel.Thank you for your help.
