Hello, Is it possible to perform svn compare  a) for individual objects and get return value if the objects have changes(when compared with a particular revision, say "HEAD") ? b) a global compare and get handles to objects which have changes(when compared with a particular revision, say "HEAD") ?I found that the command is currently available in system apiCode:system.commands["svn", "compare"].execute(arg1, arg2, arg3)Any code snippet and use cases supported in Py would be very helpful I tried so far arg1=url , arg2 = revision, arg3 = None / Bool and got the following error:Attachment:SVN_Compare.pngBest Regards,SK
