I'm working on developing a script to install all of the latest version of our libraries to the library repository, install certain packages to the package manager, and finally build the application itself and download it to the PLC. I've worked out installing libraries, however, I can't find any example code for installing packages or rebuilding applications following a library change. 1) Is there documentation for the full features of the python script language in Codesys V3 so I can see what the full functionality of the language is rather than piecing together various example scripts?2) Is there a way to install packages to the package manager via a codesys python script?3) Is there a way to force a build of a project/application via a codesys python script?Thanks!
