I have a Wago 750-842 with a program; stupidly have forgotten which version I have downloaded to it. Doing some experimenting on another -842, I find when opening a program in the PLC I end up with a different program than I know is in there.So I did the Reset PLC Original.CoDeSys complains there is no program on the controller.Download the new program. I KNOW what it is."Open" New Program > From PLC.I get a different version than the one I just downloaded.Anybody know what gives here?

The upload is only possible when you saved the *.pro to the PLC (can be a Softplc)You can compare the version in the PLC with the one compiled but it will be different.Yes version control is very difficult.

Paul,Thank you for the quick reply.Could you elaborate on SoftPLC?ThanksDutch

On any PLC you will only find a compiled version of the program, that is a machinelanguage with only bits and bytes, so a translation back to your written program is impossible.thus also an upload is impossible, only the old systems like a PS3(moeller) was possible.If needed more info just give me a call, i am living in shertogenbosch
