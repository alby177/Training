Is it possible to install devices (into the Device Repository) via a python script?In another topic (http://forum-en.3s-software.com/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=1923&hilit=Install+library+in+V3), I saw:Code:for repo in librarymanager.repositories:...Is there something like a devicemanager.repositories?Regards,Edwin.

It's on our list of planned features, however.For now, there is a workaround: You can manually create a project archive containing the device, and then when the script extracts the project archive, the device should be installed automatically.HTH,Markus

Thank you, Markus.I found another work-around: manipulate the Device Repository directly.At least for devices that are specified in *.devdesc.xml files.At the location C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\CoDeSys\Devices:Copy *.devdesc.xml to the proper folder .\<Type>\<Id>\<Version>\device.xmlDelete .\devicecache.xmlRe-start CoDeSysNow the new device is available.For devices that are specified in *.eds files, I did not find an automation option. (The conversion from *.eds file to *.devdesc.xml file is the bottelneck.)I'll install these devices manually via the CoDeSys GUI.Regards,Edwin.

But that also only works with devdesc.xml files.Markus

I'll keep it mind.Thank you for the warning.

I can see that the project archive is in fact just a zip file, so would your "unofficial" advise be to change the device description zip file inside the project archive zip file? Or do you have a more nice way to manipulate the project archive?Regards,Frank

Hi, Frank,Hi, Edwin,Up-front: There exists CDS-23707 with the title "ScriptEngine: Provide an API for the device repository." - you might want to ask your support contact to add your company as an interested customer to this issue.

Or do you have a more nice way to manipulate the project archive?The official way is to just create a project archive of a project which contains all the devices whose descriptions you want to add."Inofficially", you may also succeed by just modifying an existing project archive and add all the device descriptions you need. I did not yet try this myself, however.HTH,Markus

Hi all,there is a solution for that issue  - not with python but able to automate complete.Check the CODESYS installation directory, in folder "Common" there is a file called "RepTool.exe".This is very powerful and helped me to install / remove devices from the repository.Just call it from command line with argument "/help" and you get lots of options.May it will help you guys.Regards Jörg
