Hi,I have a python script that sends a sms message to my phone when its run.I want this code to run when a led in codesys turns on.I can't figure out how to do this. I know that codesys can run python by using tools, scripting, execute script.I just want the code to run automatically to alert me of an alarm.Thanks for the help.

Hi,this sms you want to send on an alarm or IO triggered by the plc and send by the plcnot in the CODESYS developmentsystem?Because this python scription here is all in the CODESYS developmentsystem not in the plc.If you need this for the plc side,this example here should show how this could work:(But this works only if the plc side could execute python...)viewtopic.php?f=23&t=6247&p=19932#p19941BREdwin

Thanks for the help.I am using the PLC to run the python code. It can run the code on it's own.I cant seem to get my code to run. I don't have the hardware to test yours but I used your example to make my code.It seems to run the code but it does not do anything. I have tested my python code on its own and it does work.

Hi,so on which plc do you execute this?BREdwin

I am running it on a raspberry pi 3 model B.I am trying to have the single file run when a bool value = true.I can't seem to get it to work through Codesys though.Edit:Never mind I got it to work.Thanks for all the help though.

Could you specify how you made it work? I am trying to run a Python Script on a Raspberry 3 B with the _ and it does not do anything. Running the script via the command line works fine. I would appreciate any help.

Hi,did you check this?viewtopic.php?f=23&t=6247&p=19932#p19941BREdwin

Here is the code that made it work.This runs my python file sms_warning on the raspberry pi.Make sure you do this/etc/CODESYSControl.cfg:   [SysProcess]   Command=AllowAll This can be done on the pi by using the command: sudo nano /etc/CODESYSControl.cfghope this helps.

Hi,one small remark:I would recommend to move from /etc/CODESYSControl.cfg to /etc/CODESYSControl_User.cfg: [SysProcess] Command=AllowAll This has the advanatage that on an runtime update ( for example from 3.5SP12 to 3.5SP13) this settingwill be retained.BREdwin
