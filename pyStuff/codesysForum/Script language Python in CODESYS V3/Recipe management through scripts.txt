Is recipe management available through scripts? If not, is there any plan to add it in the near future

Hi,There's currently no interface provided, but I did file it as improvement CDS-45407 in our jira database, so it will be implemented eventually.

The Recipe Manager Interface would be a very useful feature for our current project. As I don't have access to JIRA (we are a systems integrator, not a device manufacturer) would it be possible to check and let me know when this feature is expected to implemented?

Hi,apart from registering with the OEM, there seems no official way for endusers to keep up to date.However, I made a comment to the jira issue to keep this thread up to date, so there is a chance that the developers responsible for this issue will poste a message here once it's fixed.Currently, the issue is not planned for the next service packs, as higher priority issues have preference.Thank you for your patience,Markus
