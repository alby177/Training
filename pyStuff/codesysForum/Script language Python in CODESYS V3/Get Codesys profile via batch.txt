Hello,I am trying to start CoDeSys with a batch file like this and execute a python script afterwards:Code:start "" CoDeSys.exe --profile="CODESYS V3.5 SP10 Patch 4" --enablescripttracing --runscript=%PYTHON_PATH% --scriptargs=%XML_PATH%This works well so far but I need to pass the --profile argument more generic. So is there a way to read the installed CoDeSys profile from the used computer in a batch script?If not...is it possible to do some hack? I saw a folder called "Profiles" in the Codesys installation folder. Maybe I could scan the file names there to get the latest installed profile.Greetings

Hi P_Groebner.P_Groebner wrote:So is there a way to read the installed CoDeSys profile from the used computer in a batch script?You can find the profile name inside the content of sys.version.Here some example code:Code:from __future__ import print_functionimport sysprint("--- sys.version")print(sys.version)Output from CODESYS V3.5 SP11:Code:--- sys.version2.7.7 (CODESYS.exe CODESYS V3.5 SP11, ScriptEngine.plugin 3.5.11.0)I think the best way to get the profile name is to match the executable name, which you can get from sys.executable, and the plug-in name 'ScriptEngine.plugin' with the leading comma and extract what is between them.BRMartin

Hi M.Keller and thank you for your answer.okay I may not have expressed myself very well, sorry. I need to read the profile before I start CoDeSys and execute my python script. I need to read it in my batch file (outside of the CoDeSys IDE), where I start CoDeSys, so that I can do something like:Code:start "" CoDeSys.exe --profile=%CODESYS_PROFILE% --enablescripttracing --runscript=%PYTHON_PATH%What I did now is to scan the Profiles folder (Default path: C:\Program Files (x86)\3S CODESYS\CODESYS\Profiles) and list all file names with a *profile extension. Afterwards I can choose the profile I want and store it in a variable. The batch script code looks like follows(you should be able to execute it, if CoDeSys is installed in the specified directory):Code:@echo offcd C:\Program Files (x86)\3S CODESYS\CODESYS\Profilesecho List all installed CoDeSys profiles:setlocal enableextensions enabledelayedexpansionset /a count = 0for %%f in (*.profile) do  (   set /a count += 1   echo !count!: %%~nf)endlocalrem Choose profileecho(SET /p PROFILE_NUMB=Choose the profile you want to use by entering a number: rem Get profilesetlocal enableextensions enabledelayedexpansionset /a count = 0for %%f in (*.profile) do  (   set /a count += 1   if !count!==%PROFILE_NUMB% (      SET CODESYSPROFILE=%%~nf      goto commonExit   ))endlocal:commonExitecho %CODESYSPROFILE%pauseexitCan you give me a short feedback on this solution? I guess it is not guaranteed, that it will work in the future. Iam also grateful for further suggestions on how to solve this.
