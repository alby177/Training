I'm having trouble to export my library using the script, only found sample to Import an XML.Can someone explain/give sample how could I use this interface?Code:string export_xml(   IEnumerable<IExtendedObject<IScriptObject>> objects,   string path = null,   bool recursive = false,   bool export_folder_structure = false,   bool declarations_as_plaintext = false)How can I gather an Enumerable of ExtendedObjects from a project that opened a library?Thanks

Sorry. To clearify: I'd like to export a lirbary - opened as primary project - to PLCOpenXML format.

To clearify: I'd like to export a lirbary - opened as primary project - to PLCOpenXML format.The "IEnumerable<IExtendedObject<IScriptObject>>" should be taken as a hint that one should pass a sequence of script objects there.The easiest way should be to use proj.get_children(false) and set the "recursive" parameter of export_xml(...) to true.HTH,Markus
