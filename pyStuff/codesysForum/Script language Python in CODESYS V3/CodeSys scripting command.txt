Hi Markus,thank you for the examples, they are very helpful!Is there any possibility to get "AdditionalInterface" of a connector via python?Do you have a description of the property parent (IScriptDeviceConnector.parent)?If I call this property then I get the connectors of the device and not the parent connector of the connector.If I call "connector.parent" I get the same result as with "device.connectors".Is this correct?One side note: The online help "ScriptEngine.chm" is not up to date (I have CoDeSys v3.5 SP4 patch1)!Best regardsDamian

Hi,Right now, there is no access to the "AdditionalInterfaces" of a connector. If you can describe your use case, I can try to file an improvement.IScriptDeviceConnector.parent is actually meant do deliver the list of connectors (IScriptDeviceConnectorSet), it is a "parent" in the sense of the object tree, not in the sense of the connector hierarchy. You can iterate over the list and filter for the connector_role property of the IScriptConnector, which can be set to ConnectorRole.parent or ConnectorRole.Child.For patches, the documentation is usually not updated (exceptions exist).HTH,Markus
