I have one given project, which keeps 3 applications for 3 different plc-types. ( I have no influence to this project structure, so I can not change it)For downloading them by script I am guessing I have to change the active application. How can I get to the application to set active?Or how can I change the active application at all?

Hi,Projects have a property active_application, which you can use to query or set the active application.Code:proj = projects.primaryapp = proj.find('Application', recursive = True)[0]proj.active_application = app

Hi, thanks for this quick answer!Unfortunatelly I found 3 appplication objects. The given project structure:Project-PLC_A--SPS-Logik---Application-PLC_B--SPS-Logik---Application-PLC_C--SPS-Logik---ApplicationIs there an easy way to detect the right application via parents property? Something like app.parent.parent ? Code:print( "findApplicationResult.Count ", findApplicationResult.Count) for far in findApplicationResult:    appPlcFound = far.parent.parent.find( "PLC_A", False )    print( "appPlcFound.Count ", appPlcFound.Count )     if appPlcFound.Count > 0:        print( "appPlcFound" )         proj.active_application = appPlcFound[1]        breakDoes not work, appPlcFound.Count = 0 three times. I am also not so much into Python so I am just guessing and trying...

Hi, ALoeffler,There are several possibilities to solve your problem: The first one is to search from the device upwards:Code:proj = projects.primarydev = proj.find('PLC_A')[0]app = dev.find('Application', recursive = True)[0]proj.active_application = appThe second one is to search the application by path:Code:proj = projects.primarydev = proj.find('PLC_A', 'SPS-Logik', 'Application')[0]proj.active_application = appA third way is to check the name of the parent:Code:for far in findApplicationResult:    if far.parent.parent.get_name() == 'PLC_A':        # do something here...In your code, the problem was the following line:Quote:Code:     appPlcFound = far.parent.parent.find( "PLC_A", False )Here, you're going down 2 steps from the application object (far.parent.parent points to the device in your project), and then you search for a child of that device with the name "PLC_A" non-recursively, which none exists.Note that the find() methods always return a list of objects, because each search could return more than one result.HTH,Markus

Thank you Markus! Your first solution runs perfect. Now the next problem is knocking on the door   To create the gateway and set the device active.But if I need help I'll open a new thread with a fitting topic.Alfred
