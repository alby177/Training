Thanks!There must be an other option to create a boot application, because I have an option to do it manually, where I dont have to be online or to log in.Im want to make a boot application from IScriptApplication. There also is a boot application at IScriptOnlineApplication.It just asks where I want to save the application, so I dont need to log in.My problem is, that I need to create the .app and .crc files. Manually it runs without any problem, but I want to create those two files with a python script.BR,MKeo

Get the script object for the application you want to create boot applicaiton for and call the method create_boot_application(path) with the path for the application file.Here some example code:Code:proj = projects.primaryfound = proj.find("Application", True)if not found:   raise Exception("Application was not found")app = found[0]app.create_boot_application(r"c:\temp\myapp.app")BRMartin
