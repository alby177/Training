Hi,Is it possible to get information which object/ device editor is currently active in CODESYS or which device/ object is selected in device tree.I want to write a script which changes some parameters in the current open device or selected device in device tree.Thanks

Hi.No, it's not possible but I see the use case. I added the improvement CDS-45354 to our bug-tracking.BRMartin
