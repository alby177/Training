Is there a way?I added some example code which changes the setting but it does not work at the moment because of a bug. When CDS-53974 is fixed the example will work but it is not on the roadmap at the moment.Code:proj = projects.primaryfound = proj.find('Device', True)if not found:   raise Exception('No device found')dev = found[0]driverinfo = dev.driver_infoif not driverinfo:   raise Exception('No driver info present')driverinfo.always_update_variables = AlwaysUpdateVariablesMode.AlwaysInBusCycleBRMartin
