Hi learnetk.From the subject I think you want to generate documentation for a library but from the text I get the impression you want to generate documentation for your scripts. Which is the correct one?If you want to generate documentation for a library did you use CODESYS Libdoc? See "Library Development Summary" and "Script your Documentation" in the online help.BRMartin

Hi Martin,I am using Codesys V3.5 SP6 Patch 3Firstly, i installed Python 2.7.12 along with the packages Sphinx and rst2pdf.Then started with the Libdoc scripts (as in Script your Documentation) and followed the steps as under :Step 1 : Libdoc export c:\project\lib\sysfile.library c:\project\lib\sysfile.jsonStep 2 : Libdoc generate c:\project\lib\sysfile.json c:\project\lib\FrameStep 3 : Libdoc merge c:\project\lib\sysfile.json c:\project\lib\Frame c:\project\lib\SourceStep 4 : copy the files 'conf.py' to the Source folder, remove the html part and reference to libdoc_builderStep 5 : Add in Conf.py the following changesextensions = ['sphinx.ext.todo', 'rst2pdf.pdfbuilder']pdf_documents = [('index', u'rst2pdf', u'SysFileDoc', u'Test'),]Step 6 : sphinx-build -b pdf c:\project\lib\source c:\project\lib\build>sphinx-build -b pdf c:\project\lib\source c:\project\lib\buildRunning Sphinx v1.4.9loading pickled environment... failed: source directory has changedbuilding [mo]: targets for 0 po files that are out of datebuilding [pdf]: targets for 27 source files that are out of dateupdating environment: 27 added, 0 changed, 0 removedreading sources...

Hi learnetk.Why didn't you use our tool to generate the PDF? For that you have to transform the source to LaTeX which can be converted to PDF. See "PDF Output Format" in the online help.Maybe you should use a newer version of CODESYS to create your documentation because there were some bugs in the early versions of the tool.BRMartin

Hi Martin,Thank you ..!!That works, as described in the section "PDF Output Format". But how could i add multiple .tex files to make a single document.Thanks and warm regards.
