Hi,i add a plc via script to an empty project. Then i want to add an Ethernet Interface as a profinet master. The problem is to Change/configure the inteface (eth0, eth1) by script.Can somebody give me a simple code snippet to configure that Interface. My second problem is the device id of the profinet slaves. The id's are like: 0x002A_0x0301_DIM 19. (Siemens IM151-3 PN ST V7.0). That id throws exceptions.....Thank you

Look at my example in my previous post. You have to edit it to match your devices.Steffen_R. wrote:My second problem is the device id of the profinet slaves. The id's are like: 0x002A_0x0301_DIM 19.

That id throws exceptions.....In the attached python script the code prints all device descriptions with have the type 81 and add a ProfiNet slave device from the imported device description.BRMartin
