Hi Kevin.KevinR wrote:can I copy all online parameters to the offline parameters with a python script?A device parameter or data element in Scripting has the property "can_access_online" so you can check if it supports the online mode. If it is supported you can read the current value with the method "read_online_value(...)". If a timeout of 1000ms is enough to read the value from the PLC you can use the method without specifing that parameter.Here some untested code:Code:if data.can_access_online:   val = data.read_online_value()   data.value = valI also added a simple python script which prints the parameter tree to the Message view and change the value of one parameter.BRMartin

Hi Martin,i tried running the script but it does not work correctly. The attached picture shows the error. I think it is line 15 in the script.Thank youSteffen

Perfect!! Thank you very much... That helps meSteffen

Hi Martin,I'm still looking for a solution, to get this to work. First of all - Thank you for updating the example. The example still doesn't work for me, during I'm in the online mode. I stay in contact with one of your colleague, who has also added the issue to jira (CDS-54028).It seems like there is a problem with "read_online_value".This functionality has a very high importance for us. So maybe there are also some other customers who have this requirement. Thank you in advance.BRKevinR
