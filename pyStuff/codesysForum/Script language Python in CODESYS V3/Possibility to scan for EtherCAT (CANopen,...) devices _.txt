Is there any possibility to scan for devices like the GUI command ("Geräte suchen") for a fieldbus?As alternative there is a command available "Geräte suchen" in system.commands. Is there any information about the 2 parameters device and scan for this command ?

The problem is that you can't selected an object in the Navigator views through Scripting.BRMartin
