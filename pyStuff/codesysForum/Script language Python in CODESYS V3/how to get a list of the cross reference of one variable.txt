Hi all,I´m looking for a solution to get a list of cross references of one variable in my Python script.And if it possible a reference of a member of a struct.I found the following:   >>> system.commands["view", "crossref"].execute()   >>> system.commands['browse', 'crossreferences'].execute()   >>> system.commands['browse', 'legacycrossreferences'].execute()wich only opens the view of the cross reference in my GUI.But I need a list of the POU´s where the variable is used, such like the results in the view.Any idea´sMany thanks

Hi all,no ideas about cross references??
