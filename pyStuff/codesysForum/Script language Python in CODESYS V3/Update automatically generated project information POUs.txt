When I set the project information object using python like this:Code:projInfo = proj.get_project_info()projInfo.version = "1.2.3.4"The automatically generated POUs (GetVersion, GetTitle, etc.) are not updated.Is there any way to force a update of these using python?(I am using CODESYS 3.5.3.7) /Rasmus

Hi, Ranie,You found a bug. I filed CDS-37548 in our jira bug database.If you're working for an OEM (PLC Vendor), you can contact our support department to register your customers name for that issue. If you're an end-user (codesys came shipped with a PLC you bought somewhere), you may contact your PLC Vendors support department with the above number, so they can create an entry in their database and link it to our CDS-37548.As a workaround, you can re-set the accessor generation setting to the same value:Code:projInfo.change_accessor_generation(projInfo.generate_accessors)This will regenerate the accessor POUs.

Hi,good news: The fix for this is currently scheduled for the next service pack (V3.5 SP5, which is currently scheduled for July.)
