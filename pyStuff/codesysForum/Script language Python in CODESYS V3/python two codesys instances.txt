Hi,is it possible to check with python, if there are other instances of codesys running on the same pc?I was not able to find something similar in the Forum.

If you are interested whether there are other opened projects I think IScriptProjects.all Property is what you are looking for.If not, and you want to check that other codesys instances are running than it is a python question,maybe http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1632 ... it-windows can answer this or a google search? 

I tested the IScriptProjects.all Property. It's not what I'm searching for, I must check for other codesys instances.So I think it's a python question, maybe your link could help me, but at the Moment I don't have the time to test it. I write an answer when I have the time to check it...

I also wanted to do similar but with other program,http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1352 ... ist-outputthis one works flawlessly.
