Hello, I have a question and i hope you can help me. I want to use Python (see Code below) to get the deviceadress of my CPU an than use this address to login into the CPU via the Test Manager. If i use the code i get the right information out of the CPU but if i try to use " deviceaddress " out of Pythonscript in my Testscript, the Testmanager says the Format is invalid. Is this error because the Address is of type "string", or do i have to use a other way to get the address out of the script?Best regards SebastianCode:# Find device objectfound = projects.primary.find('PLC_AC500_V3',True) #('PLC_7', True)assert(found and len(found) == 1, 'No or more than one device found')dev = found[0]#print (dev)# ==============  Find gatewaygw = online.gateways['Gateway-1']deviceid      = dev.get_device_identification()#print (deviceid)devicegateway = dev.get_gateway()#print (devicegateway)deviceaddress = dev.get_address()print (deviceaddress)  # => Output 03C8.9000.2DDC.C0A8.090Bprint 'type',type(deviceaddress)

If you want to use the Scripting API for the gateways to scan the network and find a suitable device then you can just configure the communication path through Scripting and also just login in the test script.BRMartin

Hi Martin,thanks for the quick answer. I need the address because I use Unit Test´s with the Testmanager and for this Type of test  the Testmanager needs the Deviceaddress. The second reason is that i work with the Automation Builder from ABB and with different versions of the Automationbuilder the deviceaddress changes and so i have to read it out with every Version i use my test on.Best regards Sebastian
