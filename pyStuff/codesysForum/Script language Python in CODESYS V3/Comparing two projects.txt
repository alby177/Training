In order to get familiar with the python-interface, I try to compare two projects.Using this command:system.commands["project", "compare"].execute(pathProjectArr)with a string as argument, the Interpreter complains about the arguments type.It is supposed to be type FILE/SC instead of string.I am wondering, what the FILE/SC-Type is.I also tried to pass a file handle (from f = open(pathProject, 'r'))and using Arrays in different ways, but had no luck yet.Where can I get this file type? Is the error message appropriate?

Hi CS3user.If you want to compare with an other project file you need the following 5 entries in your string array:"FILE"Complete path to the project file"true" if you want to ignore whitespaces, otherwise "false""true" if you want to ignore comments, otherwise "false""true" if you want to ignore properties, otherwise "false""SC" stands for Source Control, the obsolete predecessor of the current SVN Add-on.BRMartin

WOW that was fast!! Thank's I'll try it.After all I'd like to have my script directly running from the GUI (via menu item or symbols).Are there chances to make a menu item executing this specific script directly instead of clicking Tools > Scripting > Execute Script...Can I do this with package designer?

Hi CS3user.Right now, this is not yet possible, but this improvement is already listed in our Jira tracker CDS-45695 , so it will be implemented eventually.It should add the possibility to easily start scripts in the UI via menu command, context menu, toolbar.BRMartin

Hi Martin,Is it possible to obtain a handler to objects in the local project which have changes in them (after compare)?. BR,SK

Hi codesys_sig_forum.codesys_sig_forum wrote:Is it possible to obtain a handler to objects in the local project which have changes in them (after compare)?There is no Scripting API for the project compare at the moment, but it is already listed in our Jira tracker CDS-47389. It is not planned because there are still some open issues.BRMartin
