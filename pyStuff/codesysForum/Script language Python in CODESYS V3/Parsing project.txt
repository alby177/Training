Hi,I'd like to parse my current  project / library files to apply some checks :* unused variables, * bad naming, * indentation * retrieve variables names for documenation* etccan someone points me to how to do this please ?Cheers,

Hi,Most of those things should be caught by the Static Analysis Add-On.The variable names for documentation should be available via PLCOpenXML export, and then parsing the XML file.
