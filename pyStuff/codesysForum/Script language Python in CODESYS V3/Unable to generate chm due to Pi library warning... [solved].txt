Hi everybody!How can I resolve the following? I want to generate a chm file from a library using libdoc. Should be no problem, but certain library from the raspberry pi libraries is crashing my party. I need this library reference in my own library and it produces 2 warnings. The libdoc script library does not ignore them The cause is Raspberry Pi Peripherals 3.5.11.0, TransferExt [spiMaster]Code:DocExport: Build...Build: Text: C0: ------ Build started: Application:Â  -------Build: Text: C0: typify code ...Build: Warning: C33: Type 'POINTER TO ARRAY [0..255] OF BYTE' possibly not convertible to type 'ULINT'Build: Warning: C33: Type 'POINTER TO ARRAY [0..255] OF BYTE' possibly not convertible to type 'ULINT'Build: Text: C0: Compile complete -- 0 errors, 2 warningsCompile done in 02.63 sec.DocExport: Processing... Error: Error during project processingDocExport: Closing project... Done.Result: 1 -- Error!Is there some way around this without tinkering in the raspberry pi libraries? Or any other solutions? I need to generate this doc.

@Edwin S:  Have you got some tips or hints, alernatives? Because, I need to generate the documentation...

Hi,is it possible to send the libs and steps how to reproduce it?BREdwin

Dear Edwin,Is there a way to get more verbose out of the make command?Because after trying "libdoc make IoDrvPiXtend.library IoDrvPiXtend.chm"  => this yields  a .chm file, but I do get the typecast warnings from the SPI library function transferExt(); again;DocExport: Loading project C:\temp\IoDrvPiXtend.library...Project loaded in 07.95 sec.DocExport: Build...Build: Text: C0: ------ Build started: Application:  -------Build: Text: C0: typify code ...Build: Warning: C33: Type 'POINTER TO ARRAY [0..255] OF BYTE' possibly not convertible to type 'ULINT'Build: Warning: C33: Type 'POINTER TO ARRAY [0..255] OF BYTE' possibly not convertible to type 'ULINT'Build: Text: C0: Compile complete -- 0 errors, 2 warningsCompile done in 02.32 sec.This means that the; Build: Warning: C33: Type 'POINTER TO ARRAY [0..255] OF BYTE' possibly not convertible to type 'ULINT'Build: Warning: C33: Type 'POINTER TO ARRAY [0..255] OF BYTE' possibly not convertible to type 'ULINT'messages are not the root cause of the problem that my own library fails to generate a .chm file, while it compiles without errors.AlsoThis board does not allow (deliberate?) to contact admins etc via email.So could you please PM me your instructions and adress to which  I can send it?Thank you in advance!

Hi,just login to the CODESYS store and use the 'my question_ to rise a bug report support case.There you could attach the libs and additional Information.BREdwin

Dear Edwin,Thank you for the advice. In the meantime I have managed to deal with the issue's as described in the help;Step 1 => generate JSON file, watch command line verbose and resolve any issue's in original library,Step 2 => generate the frame directory, also watch verbose and deal with any errors in appropriate way (can be done in lib or in frame source, but first is nicer).Step 3 => generate (or merge) so that we can generate a Chm|PDF|HTML etc.Make *.lib *.chm chains the above commands, if something fails, the process aborts. So using the intermediate commands will track the real issue's.Anyway thank you!
