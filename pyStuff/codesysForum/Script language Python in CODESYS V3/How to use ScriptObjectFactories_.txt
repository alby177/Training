Hi,In the script engine documentation for V3.5 SP1 Patch 2, I have noticed that a script object factory object is present. Has anyone used this and is able to explain how to use it?Under ISystem2 members I see a property called "factories", so one should be able to useCode:system.factoriesas an entry point. However, when I try this I get the following error:Quote:[INFORMATION]   test.py(8): Begin of script[INFORMATION]   test.py(8): system.factories[INFORMATION]   test.py(8): exception (<type 'exceptions.StandardError'>, StandardError('Exception has been thrown by the target of an invocation.',), <traceback object at 0x0000000000000034>)[INFORMATION]   test.py(8): system.factories[INFORMATION]   test.py(8): exception (<type 'exceptions.StandardError'>, StandardError('Exception has been thrown by the target of an invocation.',), <traceback object at 0x0000000000000035>)[INFORMATION]   test.py(8): system.factories[INFORMATION]   test.py(8): Return from script[INFORMATION]   test.py(8): system.factoriesRegards,Frank

Hi, Frank,I tried your example, and actually, you found a bug.  I filed the bug into our Jira system as CDS-30637, and fixed it.The fix is currently scheduled for the next service pack (V3.5 SP2).Thank you for your feedback!Markus Schaber

Hi Marcus,I will be looking forward to try out the feature in SP2 then.It seems that there will be a lot of new features in the script engine in that version. The documentation in SP1 Patch 2 gives a taster, since it includes documentation for some of the objects that will first be available in SP2  Is SP2 still scheduled to be released during december 2012?Regards,Frank

Yes, the current schedule for V3.5 SP2 is still mid-of-december 2012.
