I am trying to run a script which accesses the project and does manipulations to it. This is run through command line. When I run it with --noUI option projects.primary returns None in the script.It runs fine when run with UI. Am I missing something here.It can be recreated with the project and script attached and the following command:Code:"C:\Program Files (x86)\3S CODESYS\CODESYS\Common\Codesys.exe" --noUI --project="UnitTests.project" --profile="CODESYS V3.5 SP9 Patch 5" --runscript="t1.py"

When you have to open different projects, you can open the project from within the python script but use the parameter --scriptargs to transfer the project path to the script.BRMartin
