When a library is compiled by "Check all pool objects" from Build-menu and there occure build errors (which are displayed in die Build message window) it is nevertheless possible to save the library as "compiled library" - why?How can build/compile errors be detected in a python script if the "Check all pool objects" command is also triggered by python script?Thanks in advance.
