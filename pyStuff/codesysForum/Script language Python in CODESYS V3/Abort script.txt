Hello, is there a way to Abort / Interrupt a script during it is executed   Sometimes it happens - for example during development phase - that a script will not finished or hanged up   The only way to continue working will be close CDS (via Task Manager)  

Hello,Since V3.5 SP6, scripts are interruptible by the user (but can override that behaviour, and also output progress information using a progress bar).HTH,Markus
