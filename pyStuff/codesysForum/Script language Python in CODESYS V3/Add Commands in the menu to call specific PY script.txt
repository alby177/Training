BUT in the upcoming release of CODESYS V3.5 SP9 we added a new feature which might suites your needs: Quote:The CODESYS base directory can contain a sub directory "ScriptDir" which will be searched for python scripts with the file extension ".py". The found python scripts can be executes through the new popup menu "Scripts" below the existing menu "Scripting".You can use it by adding the new commands "A" ... "Z" and "..." from the ScriptEngine Commands to a new popup menu or any other place you want.BRMartin
