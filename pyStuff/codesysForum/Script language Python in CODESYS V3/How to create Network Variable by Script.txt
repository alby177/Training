Hello,i want to add some Netwerk Variable (Receiver and Sender) in my project by using script. There are some scripts (command or method) support this feature?  I can find nothing about this issue in Script online help of CDS v3  sp11.  Thanks for any replay!

Hi hhz,I am not sure if there is a scripting API for this, but depending on your use case there might be an easier solution.You can link every kind of a GVL (so also an NVL)  to an external file. This is imported before compile. If you just want to push variable declarations into the project, this method is very easy.To do the link just right click on the NVL and open the properties.BR,IngoGesendet von meinem LG-H870 mit Tapatalk

Hi Ingo,thanks for replays!In fact I  do not want to use Import /Export function for creating new project. As my experience shown, Im-/export function does not works  anytime and anywhere. My purpose here is to automatically generate a new project, incl. IEC code, configuration, parameter setting etc.. The similar as manually generating project the better. In that case, a scripting API is requested.
