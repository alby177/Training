Hi,I am trying to run Python script using Test Manager's "ExecuteExternalCommand" and I have an error message stated as,"The system can not fine the file specified"Basically, What I want to do is,1. Calling Python script i.e. DCSWITCH from a specified directory with an argument i.e. "SET{SWITCH1|MUXA|BANK1|CH101|CLOSE}".    - python C:\SCP\SCP\34970A\DCSWITCH.py "SET{SWITCH1|MUXA|BANK1|CH101|CLOSE}"Hence,there is no issue when calling using command prompt.I have attached a screenshot.Please advice.

Hi,Did you try to pass absolute pathes for both the python.exe and the script?
