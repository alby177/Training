The Scripting is used for testing or automating tasks, like for example create a project from an external configuration.If I remember correctly there were some threads about reading and writing values from/to your IEC application on the Raspberry Pi. I think the options were to use a fieldbus protocol, TCP/IP socket or OPC UA. Look in our sub forum for the Raspberry Pi.BRMartin
