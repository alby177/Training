Hello,Currently I'm using Profinet Coupler and with it I can write parameters to module without creating new application, but using "Write all values" button. Is there a way to substitute the mouse click on a button by python script code?

Is there a way to substitute the mouse click on a button by python script code?Currently, this is not possible via Scripting. In our Jira database, the improvement CDS-22506 exists to implement device configuration via scripting. You should ask your support contact to add your company as an interested customer to this issue.Thank you for your feedback,Markus Schaber
