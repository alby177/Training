Dear Community,is it possible to use the script Engine dll with .NET instead with python? I'm not familiar with python. The whole "Script Engine Plugin API Reference" is written for .NET. Thank you in advanceRegards,Kevin

Hi,KevinR wrote:is it possible to use the script Engine dll with .NET instead with python? I'm not familiar with python. The whole "Script Engine Plugin API Reference" is wirtten for .NET. Curently, only IronPython is supported.The Script API Reference got some major overhaul recently, I think it might be shipped with V3.5 SP10 Patch 1.If you want .NET Access to the CODESYS APIs, we have a product called "Automation Platform", but it's mainly targetet to OEMs, not end users.
