Hi,Is there a command to build a project or "Check all Pool Objects" from the script engine?I cannot find any information on commands like this in the documentation for CoDeSys V3.4 SP3 Patch 1.Best regards,Frank Jepsenkk-electronic a/s

Hello,Currently the online functionality implicitly triggers a build.We have explicit build commands on our TODO list, but I cannot provide a specific release date yet.Thanks,Markus

So a strategy could be to create a ScriptOnlineApplication, login, and then call "source_download"? I guess this is the method that triggers a build...?

Hi,The login should already trigger the build.Source_download is meant to store the source archive on the device, so that the service technician can connect with CoDeSys without having the source on his notebook.Markus
