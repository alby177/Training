Good morning,Has anyone tried to connect a weintek panel to the raspberry with codesys? I'm trying to communicate with the "Codesys V3 ethernet" protocol, but communication has big problems. Does anyone know how to suggest the right direction for the Hmi Weintek and the Raspberry to communicate?ThanksMassimo

Hi,Which OS is running on the Wintek?BREdwin
