Hi, I'm trying to connect Raspberry with Siemens ET200SP by Profinet. I made Raspberry as IO Device and PLC Siemens as Profinet Controller, but communication doesn't work. Please check my configuration of Raspberry in CodeSys.

Hi,did you take care on this points here?viewtopic.php?f=23&t=6247&p=16870#p16870BREdwin

I've seen this point but I don't understand one thing, Raspberry has only one LAN interface eth0, so do I have to add eth1 interface? Otherwise I tryed to do things from your link, but when I execute command ifconfig eth1 promisc, the console receives this information: "eth1: ERROR while getting interface flags: No such device"

Hi,sure you need to use eth0 if this is your profinet lan...In my example there is a usb to ethernet adapter for profinet available,BREdwin

Hi all,I'm trying to do this same thing right now (trying to connect a SIEMENS ET 200SP as a Profinet Controller to a Codesys enabled Raspberry 3). I have not luck so far.From this thread I understand that it should be possible, but I don't know if anybody has succeeded. I think that my problem is how to express in Step 7 the memory address of the variables in CODESYS.Any experience out there?Thanks in advance.
