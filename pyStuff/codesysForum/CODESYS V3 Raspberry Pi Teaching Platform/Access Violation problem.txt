Hello everybody,I am developing an application on an Opus A6 screen (Wachendorff constructor) and I have an "access violation main task" problem (see below). 1427560942, 0x00000011, 8, 81, 3, *EXCEPTION* <exception>AccessViolation</exception> <app>Application</app> <task>MainTask</task>When I put a breakpoint anywhere in a function block that I know is functional, the application crashes and a green screen appears.Furthermore, I found that the exception is coming as soon as I log, without running the application.And, when I'm in "Simulation mode" on my computer, I can put breakpoints with no problems...Do you have an idea? Thanks for all.Best Regards
