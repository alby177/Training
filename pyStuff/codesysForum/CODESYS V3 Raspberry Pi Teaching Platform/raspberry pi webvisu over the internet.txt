This is your WAN IP, so you'll need to connect to your LAN IPs (e.g. 192.168.1.X) via port forwarding. Since web visualization runs on port 8080 (e.g. 192.168.1.123:8080/webvisu.htm), make sure to forward that port. After you've done this, you can type in 27.28.29.30:8080/webvisu.htm and should be able to see the visualization.By setting up DDNS, a hostname is linked to your IP address instead. For example, you can type in http://eamonn.ddns.net:8080/webvisu.htm instead of 27.28.29.30:8080/webvisu.htm
