Hi!Can somebody give me a working example how to write 10 rows of text to a fileand another example hopw to read back those 10 rows.I wanna do some kind of settingsfile for my Project, and wanan retain the settings no matter what happens, powerfailure or new PLC-program download for example,an old-school settings.ini file/U

Hi,sure possible ro do it by anyone, but another option might be to use:http://store.codesys.com/mixedsearch/mi ... duct_area=BREdwin

Of course its an option, but I don't need it to be that fancyjust want to save ten variables to a file, and on "first scan" read the variables from the file./U

This is very easy with OsCat Network Library.  Network Library has file system Function blocks.There are include demo programs with the library. Here a link to latest version.http://www.oscat.de/community/index.php ... g9460.html

Hi,thanks jzhvymetal, I would recommend to use the versions from CODESYS Store,namespaces are registered etc... and aditional advantage you get a notification in package manager if an update is availabe.http://store.codesys.com/mixedsearch/mi ... duct_area=OSCAT BASICOSCAT NETWORKOSCAT BUILDINGare available.BREdwin

jzhvymetal; do you have any code-example that i can look at?/U

urbanlarsson,I only have the structure text demo program that was included inside the library.  I can attach them if you want.  If you install the package you should be able to see them in the demo directory of the library. Edwin SchwellingerI have updated the libraries can someone update the packages? Plus my network library uses the new CoDeSys 3 libraries. The latest are as follows:Updated Network Library 1.30Updated Basic Library 3.33
