Hi at all,if I wanted to do one operation every day at the same time as I could make in LD?Many thanks, Alberto

Hi,there is already an example here: viewtopic.php?f=23&t=6247#p12396 a little more details, one option would beyou could use timer2 from Oscat building library.Install these two OSCAT libs Basic and Building in CODESYS (->shopping cart and then install by clicking in the embedded browser in CODESYS - download - sure you need to login to the store)Then use attached Project example (not LD but CFC should be reasonable or at least you could easily translate this to LD)BREdwin

Thanks for the info, but I do not know how to insert the timer 2 graphic in my ladder.how can I do ?

I managed to implement the code in my project by copying and pasting what I needed.Now I do not know how to connect the Q output of timer 2 to a contact of my ladder.Can you tell me how can I do?Thank you, Alberto

Hi,BREdwin

many many thanks !!

it is normal that when you start the application on the active plc, timer2 the Q output even if the time is not the trigger?alberto

Hi alberto,guess yes, think this is 'as designed' - once a day you get this day event.. on first even if the time is already over-> once a day - Q -> True.Sure on the following days the time and Q does fit.BREdwin
