Hi! I'm testing a lot of different things with the pi and CODESYS and sometimes the pi (or the CODESYS runtime) crashes. So my question is if I can just restart the CODESYS part without rebooting the pi.I'm also wondering if it is possible to stop a running task from the pi command line, if it has lost connection to CODESYS.And one last question, is there a setting to not have a boot application? It's a little bit annoying to crash and reboot to a crashing app.BRSimon

Hi Simon,you could use:Code:sudo service codesyscontrol stopsudo service codesyscontrol startto stop and start the plcThe default is to generate a bootproject but you could change this in your project underapplication ->properties->  boot applicationBREdwin
