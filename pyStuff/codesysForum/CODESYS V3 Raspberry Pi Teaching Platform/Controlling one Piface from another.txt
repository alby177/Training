Hi,I have got 2 raspberry pis integrated with two Pifaces. Now, I want to control the LED of one Piface by the switch of the other and Codesys is one of the technologies I want to use. Can someone guide me how to do this, since I am considerably new to Codesys. I have tried doing this in one single project, creating one network variable list (sender)in device 1's application, and using that variable by NVL (receiver) in the other device's application. But, there are some errors in this method and the POU in my first device is not logging in and showing errors. Is it not possible to do this in a single project or shall I be using 2 PCs connected in the same network? A little help would be amazing.Kind regards,Aranya
