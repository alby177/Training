Does all programs in a task calls exactly at the same time ? I have the ability to move a program up and down and that makes me wonder.

I was hoping a CoDeSys employee would jump in, but looks like they missed this one.My gut feeling is the calls will go in order of the POUs as listed.  So if you have a Main Task with POUs 1,2 and 3, then the task will run POU1, then POU2, then POU3.  I think this because CoDeSys can run on embedded controllers using an MCU that can't really run multi-threads or anything like a full blown CPU.  If someone else has more info, please chime in!
