Is there a way to detect that a client is connected and is able to communicate with webvisu? My concern is that a user loses connection over wifi and is not able to stop the plc remotely. Ideally I would like to have a variable that could be used to enable a safety latch.

Hello,Still looking for a solution to this. If anyone has any advice it would be most welcome! Google is giving me nothing, at least not with the search terms I'm coming up with.

Hi,check the examples here in the PI section:viewtopic.php?f=23&t=6247&p=13503#p13503BREdwin

maybe I'm starting to get somewhere.I can see that when I watch the auto logout timer, the time will start ticking down from 50 days one the first client login (webvisu loaded into browser) and stops when I disconnect the client from wifi. Is there a variable that will simply allow me to tell if the webvisu client is connected? Is there a timeout flag of srts that can be seen when I close my wifi connection on the client end?

I keep forgetting to update this thread.I never did find a status bit of sorts or even a variable with number of clients connected, etc. I wasn't even able to use the client type function, since they returned nothing or ??. I did however use the auto-logoff countdown timer to determine when a client was present and used it to control a safety latch when the user is toggled into a certain run mode.If there is a simpler way to just see if a client is there or not, via a BOOL or other variable, (eg: number_of_clients = 0) please let me know.

HelloI am doing the same thing, do you know what happens when the autologout runs out?
