Good evening,do you think bit5 is not active?What can be caused?Thank you, Alberto

Do you use the variable linked to bit 5 anywhere in your code?  I have seen the compiler "compile out" the update over bus systems when the variable I have mapped is not used at all.  You need to at least just have a line in PLC_PRG with your variable and a semicolon.

Agreed, I'd say you are not using the variable in the application.Sent from my SM-G935F using Tapatalk
