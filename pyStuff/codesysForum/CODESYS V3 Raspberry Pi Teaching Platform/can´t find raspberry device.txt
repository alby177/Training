Hello I need your helpI can´t get any connection with codesys und my raspberry pi.The default Gateway settings are working and I´m logged in over puTTY.the raspberry has a static IP.Do I need an additional library for the connection?Is it possible that I need CAA device dignosis to get connection?In the libryry download manager I allways get a download error when I try to download the the missing library 'CAA device diagnosis'I´m using codesys 3.5.8CODESYS Control for Raspberry Pi: 3.5.7..1

Hi I have the same problem with my devices. In my case only solution was to  downgrade cosesys runtime on Raspberry Pi to 3.5.7.0.( which  is not the best thing to do) I have a plan to make a fresh install of codesys (not upgrade ) and see how it will work..

Hi,@Jonathan check if the plc runtime is running on the pi by Login by ssh (putty)for example use 'top'  or cat /tmp/codesyscontrol.log@LukaszBienwhat happens if you use 3.5.8.0 runtime on the pi?BREdwin

Hi Edwin.On the newest version of codesys runtime I have the same problem. Even when I type in correct IP address, I have message that 'No device is responding to scan request' unfortunately..I've checked running processes ( 'TOP' )  and it looks like codesys is not running after update ( 3.5.8.0) and reboot of RPi..Update.After 'fresh' install of Codesys ( no previous versions on image) all looks good. I can find Raspi device with no problem.

Hi,if the debian and kernel is in current state it should work.Which version/distribution are you using exactly?sudo apt-get updatesudo apt-get dist-upgradesudo rpi-updateshould solve in any case the problems.sure a:sudo raspi-configis needed too (this is what you should after install the raspbian from raspberrypi.org)1. to enlarge the CD Card space2. to enable device tree and SPI and I2C  (enable Onewire if needed)BREdwin

Hi,I'm using Emlid image for Raspi B+,linux kernel :Linux RaspiBPlus 3.12.36-rt50+ #1 PREEMPT RT Tue Jan 20 02:28:06 MSK 2015 armv6l GNU/Linuxfirmware:Dec  8 2015 14:44:44Copyright (c) 2012 Broadcomversion e591b5eb05e2cdb1b5ae25512b27d33127d7bee9 (clean) (release)'sudo apt-get updatesudo apt-get dist-upgradesudo rpi-update '                - unfortunately didn't help.Thanks.Lukasz
