Hi, I have some questions to CODESYS Control for IOT2000 SL (https://store.codesys.com/codesys-control-for-iot2000-sl.html).1. How can I generally access the GPIOs of the Siemens SIMATIC IOT 2000 Gateway IOT2040?2. How can I especially access the inputs and outputs of the IOT 2000 IO-Module?3. How can I link these to the variables in the PLC programm?From PLC programming, I know something like DI0 AT %IX0.0 : BOOL; and DO0 AT %QX0.0 : BOOL; in the var list.Actually, this is not documented in the help system: https://help.codesys.com/webapp/iot20x-f-help;product=CODESYS_Control_for_IOT2000_SL;version=3.5.11.0.A tree entry like GPIO is missing, which offers the option to change GPIO parameters and GPIO mapping.For the Raspberry Pi it is already existing: https://help.codesys.com/webapp/rbp-project-gpio;product=CODESYS_Control_for_Raspberry_Pi_SL;version=3.5.11.0.
