Hello, I'm using a RPI3 with Adafruit's PiTFT 3.5" 480x320 touchscreen (PID2441).  I also have a mouse connected to the Pi.When I use the mouse to click a rocker switch (or, equal) and Ladder for programming, everything works fine, i.e. I can click the control and the output toggles repeatedly.When I use the touch screen, however, strange things happen.  Cursor will move about on the screen so long as I don't touch the Rocker Switch.  If I touch the rocker switch, the associated variable will toggle once and then the cursor will no longer move or re-toggle the switch, i.e. I can use the touchscreen to move the cursor around and then when I touch (or double touch) the control the cursor turns to a finger, toggles the control, and then locks up.  After that I can no longer move the cursor using the touchscreen or click the control again (it's as if it just stayed down).  ...the mouse, however, continues to work just as-expected (so, codesys continues to work fine).Once the touchscreen is locked-up (and, once it's locked-up in Codesys....it remains locked-up at the RPI GuI also), I have to to re-boot the RPi to get the touchscreen to work again.And, if I don't start Codesys, the touchscreen works just fine in all aspects on the Pi Gui.Thoughts?

"This display uses the hardware SPI pins (SCK, MOSI, MISO, CE0, CE1) as well as GPIO #25, #24.  GPIO #18 can be used to PWM dim the backlight....."I had (inadvertently) left GPIO #25 setup as an output pin in my Codesys program.  In any case, once rectified, the display with resistive touch screen works well.RT
