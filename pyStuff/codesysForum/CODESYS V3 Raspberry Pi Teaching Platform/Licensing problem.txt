We are working with raspberry pi and licensing it without problems during the last few months. Now we have a problem with a raspberry license. The license has been activated and is showed as "valid" in the license edition window but, after 2 hours, the runtime stops.We have the license backup file (160kb) but we don't know how to "clean" de licensing information and restore it.This problem may be caused by cloning sd cards with old licensing information inside..We would be grateful if somebody knows how to solve it. 

Hi,usually this happens if you work with SD card Images of an licensed PI.Doing this lead to a 'broken' license container because the serial no does not fit to the cloned PI.Activating the new empty container does work. But license check fails because there is additional this broken license.So how to solve this?If you work with sd card images from already activated PI's the steps are.Before licensensing the new PI you need to delete the content of cmact_license directory.... (CODESYS plc file browser)then restart the plc runtime (as result you get a configuration with an clean empty softcontainer)-> activate the license and save the CMLicenseNew.WibuCmRaU from the runtime directory to your pc.This is a backup license file with this you could reactivate this PI which you have activated.So please check the log:cat /tmp/codesyscontrol.logif you find anything according broken license... this is exactly the case i have described above.BREdwin

thanks !!
