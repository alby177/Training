Dear All, we are testing I2C input and output cards form Horter & Kalb in the two available configurations (buffered and optocoupled i/o). We have a big problem because of the input cards, sometimes, are not working properly. The system works fine the most of the time but sometimes, in an unprerdictable way, all the inputs are activated. Moreover, not cabled inputs are activated without motivation. It appears to be a problem with codesys runtime or i2c library. Raspberry pi is writing something to the i2c address and we don't know how to face this problem....
