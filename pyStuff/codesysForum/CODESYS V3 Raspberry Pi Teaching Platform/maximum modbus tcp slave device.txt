Hi,how many modbus tcp slave device, one master can be request ? I can add more than 32 slave under master ....Thanks.

One tcp modbus master can have 32 slaves. Does it work well, if I add other tcp modbus master and 32 other slaves ?

I tried it with about 80 slaves. no problem.

Good !Thanks.

To get 80 slaves, did you add 3 Modbus TCP Masters?Can I ask how much data you read from each slave?thanks
