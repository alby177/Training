Hey community,I want to set a specifiy path for all required runtime files (PlcLogic folder). I know I've seen it somewhere, but can't remember where.How this can be configured in the CODESYSControl_user.cfg? I would like to create a separate partition for "application files" with r/w rights. The system partition should have only r rights.Thank you in advanceBR,KevinR

I would recommend not to change this path. You will not have much fun with updates this way. It might depend a bit on your exact needs, but maybe a simple "bind mount" could do the trick?S.th. like:/mnt/my_partition /var/opt/codesys none defaults,bind 0 0This way you can later do a "mount -o remount,rw /", and you will be able to update  the runtime with the deploy tool of CODESYS.Gesendet von meinem LG-H870 mit Tapatalk

Thank you, this is also a good idea to do it!
