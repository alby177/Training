Hello,I am new to CODESYS and I am trying to use EtherNet/IP.I made a small test application and get 2 errors during compiling :C0288: Cannot access private Method Assembly.GetParamNBitOffsetHow can I solve this issue ?Thanks in advance.Best regards,Steve

Hi Steve,I have tried to reproduce this,does work in my case....Everything in newest Version?Guess you need to attch the project.Ah now I got it:You are running CODESYS 64Bit and simulation is active...right?There is already an entry in our bug tracker system.Workaround: Use the Control Win (running on the same PC than CODESYS / not Simulation mode)BREdwin

Hello Edwin,In fact, I am running CODESYS on a 64bit machine but "Simulation" seems to be inactive.What do you mean by "Use the Control Win" ?Regards,SteveAttachment:codesys.jpg

Hi,see attached Picture,-start the local plc -updat you project by rightclick to this plc -login to this plcIf this is not a simulation (it looks different) problem you need to attach the project to check.BREdwin

Hello,It is not excluded that I am on the wrong way.Here is my simple test project.Regards,Steve

Hi,please update the scanner and Ethernet connector to current Version (SP11)Â´,by rightclick and 'update' device.BREdwin

Hello,I finally complete my test project with CODESYS on Raspberry Pi and I work great.Many thanks for your help.Next step : Buy a license.Regards,Steve
