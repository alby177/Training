Hello Does anyone know if OPC UA will be avaliable for the Rpi platform when CODESYS releases OPC UA for the standard?

Hi,there is no decision, maybe this could be in for all 3S runtimes:Control RTEControl WinControl for Raspberry Pibut these are rumors The release is scheduled for 3.5SP6 -> end of yearBREdwin

Thanks for your reply, rumors are also information.

Hello,I am using a RPi 2 model B, and tried several clients on the same network as the RPi. None of the clients discovered the opc ua server.How can I check whether the opc ua server is running on my Pi?Best regards,Carsten Voort

Hi Carsten,I'm sure UaExpert Client will work.Please use the example in"c:\Users\<YourWindowsUserName>\CODESYS Control for Raspberry PI\2.1.1.0\OPCUA.project" to be sure th symbols are configured ok.You could see logmessages in the plc log here (screenshot)BREdwin

Hello Edwin,Thank you for the tip. I have a connection now. Maybe something for the other users:I am using a different OS by which the jitter is only as much as 50us -> http://www.emlid.com/real-time-linux-fo ... -binaries/If you install the codesys runtime for raspi as a *.deb in this OS, the performance is great!BR,Carsten
