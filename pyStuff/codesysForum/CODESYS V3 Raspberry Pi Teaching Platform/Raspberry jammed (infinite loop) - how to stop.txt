Hello,I am a newbie with Structure Text and something happened during my testing.I was doing a WHILE loop and my best guess is that I created an infinite loop and my raspberry is now messed up...After downloading the program and RUN -> I got response that there is no connection.I am not able to establish a connection between codesys (my computer) and raspberry via "gateway".Ping is going through anyway and I can access PI with SSH.So how can I stop the program, or can I just delete the program somehow.../edit:Just to add, before this everything worked always OK.I tried to access the files now via FileZilla FTP, but can not connect. Don't know if this is related problem or not.Thanks,-Juha

Hi,I would recommend to Login by ssh (use putty for this).then execute:sudo -srm /root/app*(this removes the boot application)then a restart of the plc is neededsudo service codesyscontrol stopsudo service codesyscontrol startBREdwin
