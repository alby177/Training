Dear all,I have read all the topics related to serial communication on the forum. But 覺 cannot open serial port to communicate with my device. 1)I have modified the CODESYSConfig.cfg like this: [SysEthernet] Linux.ProtocolFilter=3 [CmpSchedule] ProcessorLoad.Enable=1 ProcessorLoad.Maximum=95 ProcessorLoad.Interval=5000 [SysCom] Linux.Devicefile=/dev/serial2) Add Symbolic Link to /pi folder#!/bin/sh# Script to start our applicationsudo ln -s /dev/serial/by-id/usb-Prolific_Technology_Inc._USB-Serial_Controller-if00-port0 /dev/serial2sudo ln -s /dev/serial/by-id/usb-DekTec_Digital_Video_BV_DTM-3237_-_OEM_DVB-S_DVB-S2_receiver-if00 /dev/serial3sudo ln -s /dev/serial/by-id/usb-Silicon_Labs_CP2103_USB_to_UART_Bridge_Controller_PDBBRK006518-if00-port0 /dev/serial4sudo ln -s /dev/serial/by-id/usb-u-blox_AG_-_www.u-blox.com_u-blox_GNSS_receiver-if00 /dev/serial5sudo ln -s /dev/serial/by-id/usb-Silicon_Labs_CP2103_USB_to_UART_Bridge_Controller_0047-if00-port0 /dev/serial6I can not open serial port with this code. it's generate error. How can i solve this problem?

Hi,which value has 'udiPort' in your application?Should be 3 for using the usb-Prolific_Technology' interfaceBREdwin

Hi Edwin,Thank you for fast response.In the morning, 覺 read your answer. I changed udiport value to 4 for using usb-DekTec_Digital_Video_BV device. After that port opened and 覺 sent some data to device.  After a few attempts the device again generate error . I thought problem was from device. Changing the device did not solve the problem. The same error still occurs. Codesys can not open serial port.Best regards

Hi Edwin,I think I solved problem. I think there is an error in the code that I wrote. When 覺 tried with yours code, serial port opened without any error. If the problem persists I will bother you again.  Thank you so muchBest Regards.
