Hello everybody,I have created a device (one library and one device description)which includes 2 MCPs.--> A MCP23017 for 16 inputs and a MCP23017 for 16 outputs.My Device which i am using is the Raspberry Pi (via i2c).In the function block of the library i have defined for my VAR_INPUTand VAR_OUTPUT my variables IN and OUT.In my project I can also responsive outputs, for example BIT 0: mydevice.OUT.0Now to my question:I want to create a new variable in the I/O image (in the project). But the problem isthat i cannot respond to my inputs and outputs with my new variable.I think i miss somehow the connection between the I / O image, the parametersin the device description and in the library.Is there a solution for my problem?It is a practical project sothanks for helpful answers!Best regardsAndy
