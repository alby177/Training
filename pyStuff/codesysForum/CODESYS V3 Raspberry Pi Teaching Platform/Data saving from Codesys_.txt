How i can autosave data in PLC (raspberry) from codesys?? i want sensor data print out. trend or trace? in visualization there is "trend storage" where it saves data???is there block for that purpose? recipe command? or how?Help pls!here is trace and trend example. how i get codesys to save that data on PLC?

you may refer to the codesys store File sample to store your data into a data filehttp://store.codesys.com/file-utilities.htmlIf you wish to spend some money can look at the CSV utility at codesys store.By the way have you expand your SDCARD. Cause if you want store data you have to expand your sdcard size on RSPI.

Thanks john!More questions:Can i make with that CSV utility tool "auto-saving" program?? can i example: save data every morning 6:00AM in direct folder??

Hi,this is for sure possible.BREdwin
