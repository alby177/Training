Hello,I recently integrated a Parallax Propeller microprocessor http://www.parallax.com/ into the Codesys environment using the I2C slave port.  Its pretty simplistic, but it illustrates using a very capable micro as a IO front end for the Codesys and Raspberry Pi.  It uses one of the I2C slave objects available on the Parallax OBEX exchange.Thanks to the folks at Codesys for such a wonderful teaching and hobbyist tool!I look forward to hopefully seeing more projects with Codesys, the Raspberry Pi, and the Propeller hopefully   I can post the Propeller Spin source code as well, if anyone is interested..the first zip file, Codesys_I2C_slave.zip is the Propeller spin file.the 2nd zip file is the codesys related files, such as the device descriptor file, etc.the screenshot is Codesys online with the Pi, and the terminal box in the upper right corner is the Prop driving the serialport for register information.
