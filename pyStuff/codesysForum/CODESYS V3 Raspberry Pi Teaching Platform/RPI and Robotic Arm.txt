I've used CODESYS for some time, but never used the soft motion aspects. I was thinking of connecting up one of the cheap robotic arm kits to a Raspberry Pi to educate myself in how to use software.Has anyone already experimented with this and got something working?What would be a good set of bits to use with a high likelihood of success?I don't have any real application in mind, just moving objects around my desk.

See forum.codesys.com/viewtopic.php?f=23&t=6247Soft motion servo example.It also comes downloaded when you download the codesys control for raspberry piSent from my SM-N9005 using Tapatalk
