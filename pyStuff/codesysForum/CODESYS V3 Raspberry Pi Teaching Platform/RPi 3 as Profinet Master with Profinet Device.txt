Hi everyone,I have a problem using the RPi 3 Model B as a Profinet Master in Codesys.My system is as follows:I have a computer running Windows 7 with CoDeSys v. 3.5 SP11 to program the PLC. The computer is connected via a switch a raspberry pi 3 Model B and a profinet device. I installed the profinet device with a GSDML-file. The device is a SCHUNK EGL90 PN.In CoDeSys I can find the RPi3. I added an Ethernet device and below this a profinet controler (with the IP of the RPi3) and below that the profinet device.When I log in everything seems to work but I do not get any values (see screenshots CoDeSys_1 & CoDeSys_2).Does anyone have an idea why? Do I have to switch lowbyte and highbyte and if yes, how do I do this?I would be very grateful to get any tip!rKtiC

Hi,everything seems ok,you just need to map varibales.. then the process varibales should work.(No mapping no processdata exchange)BREdwin

Thank you for your answer Edwin. Mapping the variables wasn't a problem but now it seems that I get values for only some of the BOOL-variables. The other ones are greyed out (screenshot ‘CoDeSys_3’).Sometimes I got also values for other REAL-variables but then they disappeared again. As you can see in screenshot ‘CoDeSys_4’ it looks like that port-001 of the PN-controller is not active. Could that be a reason? If yes, how can I activate it?rKticAttachment:CoDeSys_3.pngAttachment:CoDeSys_4.png

Hi,yes for me it is clear why.BREdwin

or use option 2:update always Setting.BREdwin

Happy New Year!Everything works now. The two bytes of status and control word have to be swapped.Thanks for the help!
