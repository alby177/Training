Hello again,I have this display http://www.galagomarket.com/index.php/item/display/566/1540_razvojni-dodatki_raspberry-pi_raspberry-pi-7-inch-touch-screen-display-with-10-finger-capacitive-touch,-raspberrypi-displayand my RPI2. How to create a picture on this display so that I can access to my variables (like on webvisualization)?Regards

Make the visualization with resolution 800x480px.Install some distribution with Chromium, and make it as autostart (as kiosk mode in fullscreen) with webadress to 127.0.0.1:8080/visu.htmlI'm using for it distribution RWK from http://www.binaryemotions.com/web-kiosk ... -webkiosk/CODESYS works great too on this distribution, but remember make update and upgrade to last kernel and FW.It's realy great way, you will get 3 in 1 PLCVisualisationWeb server for visualisation at your LAN

Can Codesys directly to form an image without an Internet browser? Something like hardware visualization in industrial PLC with HMI?

I don't think so, because CODESYS always create web visualisation.Another way s exporting your variables to some file or memory and make another program at nodejs or python for display it. (Nodejs and python graphics works with directly with framebuffer without any web client or another program.)

Another way is to run a Python program that uses Tkinter and an open source Modbus client or server, and run a Modbus server or client in the Codesys.One Modbus version:https://code.google.com/p/modbus-tk/This would allow you to full screen, and be running without the visualization.  Or Qt.  I like Tkinter since it's simple, and part of the default Python install. https://wiki.python.org/moin/TkInterThe non-web visualization is not available on the Pi - I wish it was, but if it was, Codesys's main customer base would probably have a full-on revolt.  I wish it was even an option to buy like the runtime.  It's not.I'd post a sample, but I never got around to using the Tk with a modbus interface.  I have been just using the webvisu, but this is on my todo list.
