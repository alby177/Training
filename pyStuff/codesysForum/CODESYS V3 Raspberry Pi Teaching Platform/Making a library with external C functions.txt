HelloI want to make a library to access code written in C.Is this posible on the Raspberry Pi? As an example and test, how to make a "Hello world" function in C and access it in CoDeSys on the Raspberry Pi.

Hi,this is not possible with Raspberry Pi, (Runtime Toolkit would be needed -> this is not free of charge )there is coming up a "C-Integration" with 3.5SP7 (July)Maybe this would be then an option... not clear if this will be available with the PI.BREdwin

Since we now have 3.5.9.10 are there any news on the C-Integration?

Yes, I would like to know more about this as well.  I am an independent developer and would like to make a robot interface library for a startup company's product who has agreed to cooperate.  They would provide an API through a binary c library that I would have to call.I have read on the website this only possible or your OEM partners.  But then I read Edwin's comments here and now I am not sure this is the case in the future.[edit]C-Integration is only possible with OEM Kit.  Claruification in this thread:viewtopic.php?f=11&t=7116
