good evening,I wanted to check my two electric rolling shutters via plc with codesys.Since the rolling shutters have no limit switch to connect I thought to activate a 30-second timer both to raise and lower the rolling shutters.For some time everything worked well but today I realized that the shutters did not open completely.I tried then from the normal buttons and I realized that the rolling shutters lost the limit switch settings.If I hold down the button to close the roller shutter continues to rotate.But the engine's internal limit switches do not interrupt power?Give me some info on how to handle them?Thanks, Alberto

I would still say you have to go with two timeouts, one for raise and one for lower.Yes, without limits some keep going until simething breaks and they overload.Hint: Some lose their limits when controlled on the same phase like another shutter without a relay. Don't ask me why because I never understood what's the difference between having two relays doing the same action and having a phase go to two shutters.I'd always buy shutters with mechanical limits if I can.Sent from my SM-G935F using Tapatalk
