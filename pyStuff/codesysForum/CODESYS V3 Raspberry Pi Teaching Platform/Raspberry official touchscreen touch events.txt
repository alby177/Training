Dear All,I'm trying to use touch events such as OnMouseDown or OnMouseUp associated to a button in a WebVisu screen. Those events have no effect. Is this problem related to CodeSys or is a Raspbian touch driver related issue?Thanks in advance.

Hi,how do you check this?With the store example visu Events?BREdwin

Problem solved. Some raspberry touchscreens have to be connected to the same equipontential 0V line used by raspberry. Floating 0V induces errors in touch events.
