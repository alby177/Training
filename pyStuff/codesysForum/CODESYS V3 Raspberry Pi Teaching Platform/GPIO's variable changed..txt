Hi,My GPIO's name had changed, before I had for example dwIn.23 and it worked. Now the attribution of the same port is dwIn.9.How can I get the previous order like1 3 5 7 9  11...2 4 6 8 10 12...?

HI,did you add your maaping like in the screenshot?It should not happen then.BREdwin

The problem is that this old mappage does not work even with this example.
