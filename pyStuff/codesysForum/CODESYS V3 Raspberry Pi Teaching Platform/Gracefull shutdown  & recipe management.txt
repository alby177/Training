Hi,I am putting the webvisu to the test at the moment. Now I found then option ofexecuting internal commands and I wonder, if it would be possible to use themfor shutting down the system. Comming from the windows world, I am having some difficultiesof figuring it out. Normally I would use 'sudo shutdown -h now' from a console window butI seem not to be able to run that from the visu project.And since I am asking for help already - does someone have an example on how to implementa recipe load / safe facility? The offline help says a lot here, but I am having a hard time of understanding the concept behind it. Where should the subfolder for the recipes be located,and do you need to create that folder yourself or set special user rights?Would be good if anyone had some answers for me!Thank you.

Hi Carsten,you could use 'sudo shutdown -h now' triggered by a button ... search the forum for reboot by gpioviewtopic.php?f=21&t=5714According recipe management will give you an example project as soon I find the time to do one.BREdwin
