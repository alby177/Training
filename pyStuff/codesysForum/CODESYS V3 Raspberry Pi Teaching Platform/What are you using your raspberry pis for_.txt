Searching for inspiration, what are you doing with your raspberry pis and codesys runtime? I have been testing different applications during the summer and would like to here what you are doing! BR Simon

I'm using it to run my sprinkler system.I am using an Arduino Uno as a remote I/O controlling the valves and reading humidity and temperature. Communication over WiFi with Modbus protocol.

Awesome, I'm thinking of putting a thermometer in each room to start collecting data and in the future maybe control the temperature.
