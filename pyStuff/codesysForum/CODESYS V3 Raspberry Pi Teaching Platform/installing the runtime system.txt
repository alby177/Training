Hello,I have a problem when installing the new 3.5.12 raspberry pi codesys control via the package manager to the development environment. I click the install and select the package.manifest file but during installation I get an error and installation stops. in previous versions there were  files with .package extensions but now there is only the zip files for download in the store.

Hi,I would recommend to do it here:BREdwin

Strange but it worked. I have two versions of development platform on my pc which are v3.5.10 and 3.5.12. And I have runtime for raspberry installed for both versions. Do they use the same folders (C:\Users\lenovo\CODESYS Control for Raspberry PI\3.5.12.0) for installation on my pc? Any possibility of overwriting of the folders during installation process?Thanks
