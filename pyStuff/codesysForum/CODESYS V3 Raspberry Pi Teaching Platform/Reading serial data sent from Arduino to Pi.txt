Hello,I would like to connect an Arduino to three Pi's via a serial interface.  The Arduino will generate simple numbers to send to the Pi's (each gets its own unique number from the Arduino).I would like to use the UART port on the GPIO header, but I do not see any support for it in the Online Help file for the Raspberry libraries.  The Arduino will be programmed separately.To recap, I'd like to use CODESYS for Raspberry Pi to receive simple serial communication and then display it via the WebVisu interface.  Could someone point me in the right direction here?Thank you,Matt
