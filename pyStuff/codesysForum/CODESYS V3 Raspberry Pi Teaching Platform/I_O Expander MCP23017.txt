Hello everybody,I want to expand the I/Os of the Raspberry with the following IO Expander(MCP23017).I have created the „MCP23017.devdesc.xml“  and a libary „MCP23017.library“  file based on an copy of „SRF02.devdesc.xml“ und „I2C_SRF02.library“. The Rasberry indentify the MCP23017 but I can´t access with Codesys and don´t know why!!I think I fail because I didn´t use the right Parameters in “AfterReadInputs” and “BeforeWriteInputs”  to activate the chip or port. I send you some files and hope you can help me!Maybe someone worked on MCP23017 and solved my problem already.thankfully

Hi,Please look at this post for a good start:viewtopic.php?f=21&t=5744You have to add this declaration in your device configuration file if you like to use also BeforeWriteOutputs method:I haven't deep dived in the MCP23017 device datasheet yet. But I saw imediately that you are using wrong device address in your lib. For MCP23017 you have to use 0x20, suppose you have A0-A2 low (usiAddress := 16#20;).I hope this helps you further.BRZdenko.
