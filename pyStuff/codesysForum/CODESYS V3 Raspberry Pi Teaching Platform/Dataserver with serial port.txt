Hi ,I am trying to get some variables from a small PLC connected on RS232 to raspi using the DataServer.I have modified the CODESYSConfig.cfg like this:[SysCom]Linux.Devicefile=/dev/ttyAMAportnum := COM.SysCom.SYS_COMPORT1[CmpRouter]EnableLoopDetection=1EnableParallelRouting=1NumRouters=20.MainNet=ether 11.MainNet=MyCom[CmpBlkDrvCom]Com.0.Port=1Com.0.Name=MyComCom.0.Baudrate=115200Com.0.EnableAutoAdressing=1I am not able to connect to the RS232 PLC through raspi. It seams that the Com Port is not used.Any Ideas what to do ?ThanksVolker

viewtopic.php?f=21&t=7127May be the problem is the same.BR

Thanks for your answer,but this does not look like the problem.The serial port is not used for the console and it is ttyAMA0...

to me it looks like the component CmpBlkDrvCom is not in the Raspberry.Any ideas how to get this ?
