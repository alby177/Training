Hello,I wanted to try my RPI as ProfinetDevice. I therefore downloaded the project example and followed the described instructions.Unfortunately, my CODESYS Profinet Device is not running and is displayed with error sign even though the PN-Device Status is in RUN-Mode.In my sencond RPi which I tried to use as ProfinetMaster, I cannot find the slave device (no problems with other devices).I work with the latest version of codesyscontrol (V3.5.10.2).Any ideas?Best regards,Oleg

Hi,is the ethx Adapter on PN device Pi in 'promisc' mode?Check the logger in the plc logger on pn device PI.Is there a message on missing PN device license?BREdwin

Hello Edwin,I added the 'promisc' command to /etc/rc.local. Now everything is just fine.Unfortunately, I did that on my PN-Master first instead of the PN-Device. Thank you for your support!Best regards,Oleg
