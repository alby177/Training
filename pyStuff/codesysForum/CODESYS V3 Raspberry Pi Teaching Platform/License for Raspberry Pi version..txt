I had been trying to bye a license for Raspberry Pi, but, the response in the store was that I may be in a location where this is not possibly (Russia), a bit strange message, but I could contact CoDeSys, so I did and the answer so far (a few weeks) is silence.Am I the only one that get this service? I am thinking, A company that do not want to sell a license to a costumer that contact them, strange, very strange.

ХЗ я нормально покупал по карте без проблем. Заходишь в стор и покупаешь.

You are right - it is really a shame that political and/or formular regulations make it impossible that we can sell such licenses directly to registered CODESYS Stores, who have entered "Russia" as their domicile. We apologize that!You can contact our Russian Distributor Prolog who is able to sell you such licenses.Thank you for your understanding.
