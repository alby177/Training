Hi i was wondering if someone now how to create a new modul/device for example a sensor that isnt included in the standard liberary provided by Codesys. If someone might have an example of this would that be extremly helpful.

Hi,please read this documentation/descriptions here:"c:\Users\<YourWindowsUsername>\CODESYS Control for Raspberry PI\3.5.8.0\Documentation\RaspberryPI_CodesysV3_FirstSteps_EN.pdf" There are so many open libraries and devicedescriptions which you could open and These should Show how it works."c:\Users\<YourWindowsUsername>\CODESYS Control for Raspberry PI\3.5.8.0\Libraries\" "c:\Users\<YourWindowsUsername>\CODESYS Control for Raspberry PI\3.5.8.0\Devices\" In the Forum other user share their libraries and devicedescriptions:viewforum.php?f=23they are open too (library are open open it with CODESYS)BREdwin
