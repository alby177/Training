Dear all,in my project I'm using Raspberry PI B+. I need quite a number of inputs. Everything is working, but not GPIO 5 and 6. Both are always TRUE. (See pictures) What is wrong with my programming?Than you very much for your reply.Joachim

How have you connected the inputs to the GPIO's?

Hi ZorAxe,I have all inputs connected to the GPIO's. It seems to me that GPIO's 4, 5, and 6 are used for other things. Therefore I changed my input signals to GPIO 9 and 10 and it is working now.Thank you very much for your support.Best RegardsJoachim

I am having trouble getting inputs working with CodeSys. Do you have resistors in your circuit? Did you wire your inputs to GND or to 3.3V?Thanks in advance,Krys

Finally got my inputs working last night, here is the wiring diagram that I used to make it work.
