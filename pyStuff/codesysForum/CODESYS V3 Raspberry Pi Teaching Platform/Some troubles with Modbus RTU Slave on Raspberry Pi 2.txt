We have some problem with Modbus RTU (in slave mode) on Raspberry Pi 2. We add Modbus_COM and Modbus_Serial_Device to our project. The project compiles without errors. When we start application in CODESYS in front of "Modbus_COM" and "Modbus_Serial_Device" instead green arrows is red triangle, in status page of this device in fields "PCI-Bus" and "Serial Port" you can see text: "No driver found" (see pic1.jpg from attach), and in log of Device we have two lines:"Update configuration failed from driver IoDrvModbusTCPSlave""License for IoDrvModbusSerial not installed." (see pic2.jpg).Same about error present in Codesyscontrol.log from /tmp dir on Raspberry PI:1453883485: Cmp=OnlineLicenseManager, Class=4, Error=0, Info=0, pszInfo=**** License for IoDrvModbusSerial not installed.1453883485: Cmp=CmpIoMgr, Class=4, Error=1, Info=1, pszInfo=**** Update configuration failed from driver <iodriver>IoDrvModbusTCPSlave</iodriver>We buy and activate license CODESYS Control for Raspberry Pi SL. Why Modbus Rtu (in slave mode) is not work in our case?Thank you!P.S.We use prolific USB-Serial Controller.
