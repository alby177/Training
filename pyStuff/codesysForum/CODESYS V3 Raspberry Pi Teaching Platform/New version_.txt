I have been running on the original CoDeSys image.I periodically would do a sudo rpi-updateupdating to the latest kernel.This morning the kernel was at 3.12.36+ and everything was working fine before I did the update.After the update, the kernel is at 3.18.3+Now the codesyscontrol task is not running.  So the update broke something.I know a new version of CoDeSys is supposed to be near release, so the question is...How soon?Thanks,Dennis

Hi Dennis,thanks for the information, you are right we will fix this to next version, at the moment it is not recommended to use rpi-update.BREdwin

Edwin,I just did...sudo rpi-updateagain.  It seems to have picked up some stuff supporting the Pi 2 B.Upon reboot, the codesyscontrol task is running again.I then did...sudo apt-get updatesudo apt-get upgradeIt seems to have picked up a bunch of changes that support the Pi 2 B.The following NEW packages will be installed:  libpng12-dev libportaudio2The following packages will be upgraded:  epiphany-browser epiphany-browser-data gnome-accessibility-themes  gnome-themes-standard gnome-themes-standard-data libc-bin libc-dev-bin libc6  libc6-dev libfreetype6 libfreetype6-dev libjavascriptcoregtk-3.0-0  libpixman-1-0 libraspberrypi-bin libraspberrypi-dev libraspberrypi-doc  libraspberrypi0 libwebkitgtk-3.0-0 libwebkitgtk-3.0-common locales  multiarch-support raspberrypi-bootloader raspi-config sonic-pi  wolfram-engine25 upgraded, 2 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded.IT did not install cleanly...Err http://archive.raspberrypi.org/debian/ wheezy/main raspi-config all 20150131-1  503  Service Unavailable [IP: 93.93.130.39 80]Err http://archive.raspberrypi.org/debian/ wheezy/main sonic-pi armhf 2.3.0-1    503  Service Unavailable [IP: 93.93.130.39 80]Fetched 335 MB in 4min 33s (1,226 kB/s)                                        Failed to fetch http://archive.raspberrypi.org/debian/p ... -1_all.deb  503  Service Unavailable [IP: 93.93.130.39 80]Failed to fetch http://archive.raspberrypi.org/debian/p ... _armhf.deb  503  Service Unavailable [IP: 93.93.130.39 80]E: Unable to fetch some archives, maybe run apt-get update or try with --fix-missing?Thought you'd like to know.I really hope the Pi 2 B will be supported by CoDeSys.  That would be awesome!Dennis

I reran the update and upgrade commands.This time it completed cleanly after a long time.Upon reboot the codesyscontrol task is not running.Is there an error log that I can look at that will tell me why the task did not start?Thanks Edwin.Dennis

Hi Dennis,I'll send you a fixed version.This issue is solved with the upcoming 3.5SP6 Release.BREdwin
