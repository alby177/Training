Is there anyway to turn GPIO or an I2C/SPI board to run a Pulse/Direction Axis?  I want to use it to control steppers with a stepper driver using Softmotion Library.  If so I would like to test with 3D Delta printer.

Any answer?

This is very interesting to me too, anybody knows the answer?

Hi,i agree these puls/direction steppers would be useful for many applications butit is no easy possible to use them by the GPIO's. ( there is no Driver available for SoftMotion and guess you need for sure additional harware / Extension board / whatever)At the moment only the EL2521 by using Ethercat solution is running out of the box including SoftMotion driverBREdwin
