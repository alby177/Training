Hello everybody,I´m trying to connect the Rpi with OPCUA. My Testfile is running fine with the UAExpert. I can write and read values. But if I try to connect my Rpi (OPC UA Server) with an OPC UA client (developed with node,js, javascript), the OPC UA Server (Rpi) doesn´t send a discovery URLs. Does anybody know what´s the issue are? I´m looking forward for some help.In the following appendix there is a image that show the current values what the server is sending to the client.  Thanks a million. Regards,Nico _______________________Raspberry Pi 3 Model BControl for Raspberry PiSoftMotion RTE V3x64SoftMotion Win V3x64Raspbain jessieOPC UA Client (node.js; javascript)
