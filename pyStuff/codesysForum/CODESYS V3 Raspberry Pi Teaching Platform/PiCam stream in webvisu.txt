Hi,maybe some of you need the info how a PiCam stream could be inserted in the CODESYS webvisu.Sure the official element in the visu will come to the 3.5SP6 release (end of the year)but this is an example how to use it now:Raspberry.org give us an  RPi Cam Web Interface this is also nice to play around with the mode/settings for raspistill and raspivid:http://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewt ... 43&t=63276sudo apt-get updatesudo apt-get dist-upgradesudo rpi-updateCode:git clone https://github.com/silvanmelchior/RPi_Cam_Web_Interface.gitcd RPi_Cam_Web_Interfacechmod u+x RPi_Cam_Web_Interface_Installer.sh./RPi_Cam_Web_Interface_Installer.sh installafter reboot you could execute the RPi_Cam_Web_Interface byhttp://IP_Rasperry this is hosted by apache webserver independent from webvisu (this we use to check all settings of the cam)Using the stream in our CODESYS webpage:copy webvisuwithcameraoverlay.htm (edit in that file the IP address of the pi) to the pi into the 'visu' directory (by codesys filebrowser) instead of calling your CODESYS Wevisu http://ip_adress_pi:8080/webvisu.htm use now http://ip_adress_pi:8080/webvisuwithcameraoverlay.htmBREdwin

Hello,Is this feature possible yet?  Is there an example project with a webcam embedded in the visualization?I tried following the first post, with the http://192.168.1.111:8080/webvisuwithcameraoverlay.htm address, but all I get is a empty box along with the rest of my visualization.  I did edit the htm file with the ip address updated in it (attached also)I remember mention of this feature being better integrated into SP6 somewhere.  I have seen the webpage object in the toolbox, but if I embed the image, using these variables for my parameters, i can't get video working.    This test address is working for me, I can view either in mjpeg streaming, or h.264.  I have the resolution set to 320x240 at 30fps.showurl: BOOL:=TRUE;URLADR: WSTRING:="192.168.1.111:9000/stream";Any advice on how to proceed?  I've tried everything I know for now.

Hi,we'll release (next week) with the 3.5.SP6 Package an example beside the other new features, Piface LCD etc..BREdwin
