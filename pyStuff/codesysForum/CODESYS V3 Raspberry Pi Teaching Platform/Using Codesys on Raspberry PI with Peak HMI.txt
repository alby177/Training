In my class we are using Peak HMI via modbus-tcp to define an HMI. We have this working with another control logic development approach from Rex Controls. But Rex Controls does not offer ladder logic as an option but Codesys doesI know Codesys provides its own HMI design and execution capability but using an external HMI design tool seems like it offers my students a more diverse educational opportunity.I believe I have seen posts here on the forum about modbus support but I wonder if there is some material I can read or an example I can follow. Peak allows you to define points (tags) and bind them to modbus registers. I would need to learn how to set modbus registers from within Codesys so I can both export state changes in the logic and then allow incoming modbus messages be converted to information that can cause changes to the logical state of the running control program. If I am managing a PiFace for example and I press a switch to light an LED, I would like that information to be sent via modbus-tcp so that the HMI shows the LED lit up. If I press an HMI switch that is mapped via an address to the actual switch, then I would want the PiFace LED to change state. I know how to create the UI in HMI, but I need some advice to have the interaction to the Codesys designed running logic.ThanksJim

Hi Jim,you could use OPC DA to connect the HMI, (this is what I see in the Peak HMI specifications ..)you need to add a Symbol configuration by rightlick on Application.There you could configure the variables which you want to publish and have accesible via the Peak HMI.BREdwin

You could check out this thread:viewtopic.php?f=21&t=5599&p=9901&hilit=modbus#p9901

One of the included native drivers is MODBUS TCP.All of the drivers, OPC client and OPC server are included in the price.Regards,Mark

Hi Mark,does it support OPCUA?CODESYS Raspberry Pi has a OPCUA Server embedded...BREdwin
