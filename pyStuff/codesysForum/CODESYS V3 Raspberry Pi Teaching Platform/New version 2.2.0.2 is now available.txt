One of the things I thought would be changed when the official release was made was this:Quote:This product is provided for testing and training purpose and may not be used in the field.but it still exists on the store site.   From the questions asked on the forum, it is almost certain the these have already been used in real production systems but I guess this is just a way for 3s to protect itself?

The hardware of the Raspberry Pi is out of our point of view not designed for industrial purposes. So whoever wants to use the SoftPLC on the Pi should be aware of it...

Thank you for the clarification.  That is what I thought.  And I agree, the hardware is not industrial.
