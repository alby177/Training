Hi !I have tryed to burn Codesys RPI image to couple (diffrent) 4 Gb SD card. It can't fit.  When change to 8 GB card, it's working.Is this normal ?  If yes, maybe you consider to update starting documentation and from Quote:Additional requirements SD-card (minimum 4GB)to Quote:Additional requirements SD-card (minimum 8GB)Best regards !Mladen Bruck

Hi,no this should work on 4GB sd cards too.If not this is an accident which we will solve with next version.The workaround is to use the Image from Raspberry Pi organisation:http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/and install the debian package from the store download  'CODESYS_Control_for_Raspberry_PI.zip\codesyscontrol_arm_raspberry_V3.5.5.20.deb'How to do it?- flash the Image from raspberrypi.org to your 4GB SD- under Windows copy codesyscontrol_arm_raspberry_V3.5.5.20.deb to the partition which you have access to after installing the image- open ssh connection (putty - google it) and execute:  sudo dpkg -i /boot/codesyscontrol_arm_raspberry_V3.5.5.20.debyou could remove after installing the plc the debian package from boot partition by  sudo rm /boot/codesyscontrol_arm_raspberry_V3.5.5.20.debThat's it.BREdwin

I also had problems with the 2.0.1.0 image.I was able to write it to a 4Gb SD card but it kept freezing while booting.I'm using a Raspberry Pi B.I finally was able to make it work by using the 2.0.0.0 image and then update it with the .deb file just like you explained.Thanks.

Hi Edwin!I'm happy with 8GB  (read "I'm too lazy to test once again").   Yet, not much expensive than 4GB. But, anyway, good to know it's possible to use smaller card.
