Does codesys image work on RASPBERRY-PI COMPUTE MODULE ? Thanks

I am also interested in this.Can Codesys run on the Raspberry Pi compute module?Thank you.

Hi,at the moment not, but panned for one of the next Versions.(no fix version scheduled at the moment)Same for A+ Version.BREdwin

Any news about support for Compute Module? It looks like codesys process works short time (about 1 minute) on Compute Module and then close.

me too, im also interested in this.when can Codesys run on the Raspberry Pi compute module?

also interested!

I want to build my own PLC.So I am very interested in Codesys + RPI compute module 3.When will it be ready?

Hi all,this will be released with 3.5SP11 (July)including:Compute Module 1Compute Module 3Compute Module 3 litePi ZeroPi Zero WlanPi Model A+so the whole Pi family will be in  BREdwin

Does the new version support Compute Module 3? IF for example I design a board with USB-to-Ethernet with 2 ports, or add more I/Os compared to the regular RPI3, how do I update the Codesys platform to support my custom board? ThanksRotem

Hi,yes should work.BREdwin

Thenks Edwin. But I had a question:If I will design a board with (for example) USB-to-Ethernet with 2 ports, or add more I/Os compared to the regular RPI3, how do I update the Codesys platform to support my custom board?

Hi,Add more Ethernet ports will work without any change,If you need more GPIOs you need to customize the GPIO library an GPIO Device description, these are open and part of the installation of the PI package. (Check the Library and Devices directory where th Pi example projects are installed c:/users/....BREdwin
