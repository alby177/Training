I held off releasing this until the official Deiban package was available.  I was able to run multiple EtherCat Servo's running CNC with the optimized image and one of the following USB Ethernet adapters.  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00007IFED/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BJOZNV2/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1This image is an optimized PI image that does not have remote desktop.  To connect use SSH (putty) with the following:user: rootpassoword:raspberry1.  By default both eth0 DHCP eth1 is static 192.168.10.20.  To change at a SSH console run SSH console "nano /etc/network/interfaces"2.  If you plan to use a bigger card at a SSH console run "raspi-config" and expand filesystem3.  Image has a symbolic link on BOOT partion so you can modify "interfaces" to setup ehternet adapters IP  on root of SD-CARD.  If you plan to use Ethercat make sure to bring up adapter without an IP for better pefomance.What the image modification the image has:1.  Uses a minimal Raspian image2.  Updates all installed Apps 3.  Updates Firmware of PI4.  Overclocks PI slightly to 800MHZ5.  Optimizes CPU governor 6.  Uses new kernel that has USB driver rewritten7.  Optimizes File system and turns off swap file8.  Uses RamLog so SD card does not cause hit in performance9.  Turns off IPv610. Uses Dropbear vs OpenSSH11. Uses Dash instead of Bash12. Allows for second USB Ethernet13. Turbo Mode turned off for smsc95xx14. Optimized Kernel Settings in  /etc/sysctl.conf15. Disabled NTP16. Installed killall that is required for Codesyscontrol script.17. Symbolic link on BOOT partition so you can modify "interfaces" on root of SD-CARDPlease let me know if you find any other optimizations for running CoDeSys.Thanks
