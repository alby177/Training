Hello, i'm a totally beginner with codesys. I want to combine the raspberry pi and a temperature sensor (mpc9808). I already made the device description and now i have some problems to make a working library. Therfore i have an example code, which i want to transfer into structured text. But it's still not working. It would be great if you give some helpful hints.

Hi,would recommend to start with an empty Pi projectadd Raspberry Pi Peripherals library and execute the write and read , readregister fb's manuallyin the project.If this lead to valid values, then next step could be implement this to the library.BREdwin
