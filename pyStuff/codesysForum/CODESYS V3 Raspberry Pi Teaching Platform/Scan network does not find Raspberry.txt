Hello together,can someone help with this connection problem?- I get a connection to my Raspberry via Putty.- Sometimes the Raspberry shows up when I do "Update Raspberry" --> Scan, but sometimes not- Once I create a project and do "Scan network" in order to find the Raspberry, it never shows up, regardless of wether I found it through the update function or not.I found this similar problem in other posts, however I did not understand all the solutions, because I am quite new to this. I tried new installation and rebooting of everything more than once.With  cat /tmp/codesyscontrol.log  I get: no such file or directoryEvery help would be very much apprechiated!Thank you,Joanna
