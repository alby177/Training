Hi,check this Android app to scan your webvisu in your network and have quick access to ithttps://play.google.com/store/apps/deta ... view&hl=enGo to the Google play store an search for CODESYS.BREdwin

What  about  full screen mode?

Hi,yes only fullscreen except the search bar... on top.BREdwin

I've been looking for a browser for android with html 5 support for the full screen. Only chrome worked well but fullscreen, so the address bar in this app is very unnecessary, as compared to chrome your application blurs the font. Great idea just needs refining maybe in the next version ??

It works perfectly with RPi webvisu an html on :8080Maybe test the app with HTTPS /TLS webserver?Feature request: Maybe the searchbar can autohide after x seconds?Anyway, nice app
