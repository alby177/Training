Hey guys.I am wondering if there is a possibility to access the GPIOs on the Raspberry Pi itself without the SPI interface provided for PiFace Digital?I thought I saw this somewhere in a video, but cannot seem to be able to insert this functionality into my project.I will add a screenshot of my project tree. I am missing the GPIOs.Thanks in advanceBirkir

Hi Birkir,if you use the 1.1.0.0 Version there is an example"c:\Users\yourUsername\CODESYS Control for Raspberry PI\1.1.0.0\GPIO.project" This is exactly what you are searching for. So you Need to update your Package from CODESYS Store (go to PackageManager in CODESYS and update it from there...)BREdwin

Thank you for your reply.I have version 1.0.0.0 so that's an old one. However, the package manager tells me there is no new update available.Is there any other way?

Hi,there is an update available!Could you check if download in the store works?You could use the project archive from following link:https://dl.codesys.com/public.php?servi ... 3fce578adeBREdwin

Hey again.I managed by manually downloading the raspberry pi package on the website, unzipping and finding it by using the "install" button in the package manager.Thank you for the help Best RegardsBirkir
