HiI see there is a log for the device (RPI). Is there any way to write to the same log location or is this dedicated for the device only information.Thanks

HiAttached an Example for writing,Errors,Warnings,Debug Messages into the plc log.BREdwin

Thanks EdwinI just have a couple of questions:Does this log information get stored in a file?If the RPI reboots, will this information be rewritten?What is "Offline-Logging"Much appreciated!

Hi,by Default it is a 'ring-buffer' (alive as Long the runtime runs)you could activating to write the log file to the runtime Directoryby uncommend the following section in /etc/CODESYSControl.cfg:(restart plc is needed after doning this)->remove the ';' to activate:[CmpLog];Logger.0.Name=StdLogger;Logger.0.Enable=1;Logger.0.MaxEntries=100000;Logger.0.MaxFileSize=500000;Logger.0.MaxFiles=3;Logger.0.Backend.0.ClassId=0x0000010B;Logger.0.Backend.1.ClassId=0x00000104;Logger.0.Filter=0xFFFFFFFFthe youBREdwin

Hello!I have a little problem with your example project.I tried to make a status message with:Code:stdLogger.AddLogEntry(CmpLog.LogClass.LOG_USER_NOTIFY, Errors.ERR_FAILED, 0, 'server started');but I only got the message "LOGGING BUFFER OVERFLOW;LOG MESSAGE DISMISSED" in the log file.Maybe anyone can help me?Best regards,Samuel
