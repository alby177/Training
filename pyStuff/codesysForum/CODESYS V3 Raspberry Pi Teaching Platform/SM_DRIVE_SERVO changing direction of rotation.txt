Hello all,can someone explain me how to change the direction of rotation of a SM_DRIVE_SERVO?Configuration of the the project is: CodesSys V3.5 SP10 - RPI - Adafruit_PWM_SoftMotion - Servos. The different servos are placed in opposite direction on a machinc and I want to drive them all clockwise.Thank's for your help!Thomas

Hi,you need to change iRatioTechUnitsNum to -1 to have opposite direction in the movements.BREdwin

Edwin, it works fine - thank you!Best wishes,Thomas

I double checked now this for servo-drives connected to the adafruit-i2c-PWM-board and there I don't see the category with the parameters like it could be seen in your pic (SM_Drive_Servo: Paramters). Could it be that this is only working for real servo drives and not for virtual drives or something like that?  Best wishes,Thomas

Hi Thomas,no you need to enable generic device configurations views.BREdwin

That's it - thank you!Best wishes,Thomas

hmm, after changing the parameter to -1 as you described the rotation has same direction.

Hi,sorry I was really wrong,you need to change the limits, see screenshot.BREdwin

...all is working now - Edwin, thank's again!Best wishes,Thomas
