Hi everyone! Has anyone used 24C32(64) EEPROM chip to saving retain variables? Is it possible? I have this part: http://www.ebay.com/itm/400503978923

You can save retain in data file like here viewtopic.php?f=21&t=5722&start=15 then use http://www.gallot.be/?p=180 and execute from codesys ./eeprom -f data -w to save and to read ./eeprom –r –f data
