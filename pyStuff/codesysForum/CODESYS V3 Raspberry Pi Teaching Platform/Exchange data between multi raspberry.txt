hi,it is possible to exchange data between 2 rpi or more like ethernet IP or modbus but not using IP address of Rpi: using ID of raspberry, MAC address or other ?

Hi,do not understand exactly the problem.Could you explain more in detail. Is the problem that you do not know the ip address of the PI (because of DHCP served?)BREdwin

Yes, it's that. IP could be change but ID ou MAC adress never change.CODESYS software is able to detect all raspberry without know IP.

You could use network variables and set up as broadcast but this is very bad practice for programming.  Best option is to set static IP ( ssh into RPi >> sudo nano /etc/dhcpcd.conf >> append the following to this file with your desired ip settingsinterface eth0static ip_address=192.168.1.XXXstatic routers=192.168.1.XXXstatic domain_name_servers=192.168.1.XXX
