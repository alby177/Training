I installed Codesys 3.5, and installed the Raspberry package.I installed the Raspberry package onto the Raspberry Pi, and all that seems fine.  I can create a new project and select the Raspberry Pi as the PLC.I can't find the examples files however.  They should be in C:\Users\myname\CODESYS Control for Raspberry Pi\3.5.9.20  but they aren't there. I reinstalled the Raspberry Pi package and made sure I clicked "Complete Install" instead of "Typical", but still no luck.Any ideas?I have attached a screenshot.  During the install it never shows it trying to install Example files.  In the summary at the end of the installation it doesn't show any example files were installed.  I have removed and re-installed it several times.  I tried both the complete and typical installation types.Brian

It would appear the examples files are NOT included in the file CODESYS Control for Raspberry PI 3.5.9.20 (US).package.  Have these been removed?  If so, how would I get them.  .package is a zip format, so its really easy to see they are not in the package, here is a list of all files in the package.Please help!
