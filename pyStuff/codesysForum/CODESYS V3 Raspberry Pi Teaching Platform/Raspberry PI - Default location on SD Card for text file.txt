HiWhere is the default location for a text file I have created using the CAA-File lib. I used their standard example which worked fine but cant seem to find that file.Running latest Codesys if it makes any difference.Thanks for the help

Hi,you could use the CODESYS file browser to check if it is there...the Default is /root/BREdwin

Thanks EdwinThat is great, I see the file. Why could I not find that file when I searched using the linux search?Where would I find this file in the linux OS file system?Thanks

As Edwin stated, the default is in the /root directory.

Hi,>Why could I not find that file when I searched using the linux search?you need to be 'root'  to search in /root soa sudo -s and then the search will find it probably.BREdwin
