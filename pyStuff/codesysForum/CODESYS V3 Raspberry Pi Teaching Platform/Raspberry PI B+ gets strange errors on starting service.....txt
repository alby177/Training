Hi,I just got my B+ version of RPi and after installing codesyscontrol_arm_raspberry_V3.5.5.0.deb as I have been doing on a normal B I get som messages that seem strange.It dissapered after reboot but I would like to know what it's about.Code:pi@raspberry ~ $ sudo start codesyscontrol starttar: Removing leading `/' from member namescodesyscontrol.bin: no process found/etc/init.d/codesyscontrol: 32: /etc/init.d/codesyscontrol: cannot create /sys/bus/platform/drivers/bcm2708_i2c/unbind: Directory nonexistent/etc/init.d/codesyscontrol: 33: /etc/init.d/codesyscontrol: cannot create /sys/module/i2c_bcm2708/parameters/baudrate: Directory nonexistent/etc/init.d/codesyscontrol: 34: /etc/init.d/codesyscontrol: cannot create /sys/bus/platform/drivers/bcm2708_i2c/bind: Directory nonexistent/codesyscontrol startedpi@raspberry ~ $The base is a rasbian installed from a NOOBS card with a freshly run update.One thing that I have changes is to enable the  camera.I can't remember seeing this on a normal B model.
