Hi,I found out some strange behaviour (I think it is somehow linked with 1-wire devices configured).The fastest task (which has fastest cycle time defined - or is the first with the same fastest cycle time defined), takes unreasonable long time to execute.I have 4 tasks:1. I2C2. MainTask3. Onewire_scan (this one is empty)4. VISU_TASKExample1 - see cycle time definitions (the fastest cycle time and the first of the same 100ms cycle time is MainTask):1. I2C .. 101ms .. priority 22. MainTask .. 100ms .. priority 13. Onewire_scan (this one is empty) .. 5000ms .. priority 204. VISU_TASK .. 100ms .. priority 31Attachment:example1-problem with MainTask.pngExample2 - see cycle time definitions (the fastest cycle time and the first of the same 100ms cycle times is I2C task)1. I2C .. 100ms .. priority 22. MainTask .. 100ms .. priority 13. Onewire_scan (this one is empty) .. 5000ms .. priority 204. VISU_TASK .. 100ms .. priority 31Attachment:example2-problem with I2C task.pngExample3 - see cycle time definitions (the fastest cycle time 99ms has VISU_TASK)1. I2C .. 100ms .. priority 22.

VISU_TASK .. 99ms .. priority 31Attachment:example3-problem with WebVisu task.pngExample4 - all cycle times set to 100ms BUT NO 1WIRE DEVICE IS CONFIGURED - all tasks run normally1.

I can confirm it is linked to OneWire device beeing configured.As soon as I configure only one DS18B20 1-wire meter I have problems with cycle time described above.If I delete all DS18B20 devices, cycle times are normal (so I think).BR,Gregor

Hi,you need to add a own task for the onewire handling,you Need to take care that you do not reference other outputs in this Task.Check this with the Taskdeployment.BREdwin

Thank's Edwin,this is it. Defining task for onewire helps!The only comment I have with connected 4 DS18B20 thermometer, task for reading temperature takes 3.3 seconds, which I think is very slow. But now this is own task, so no problem.Thank you.Gregor
