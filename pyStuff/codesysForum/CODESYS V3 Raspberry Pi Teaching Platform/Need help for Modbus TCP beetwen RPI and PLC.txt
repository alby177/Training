Hi everyone,I try to use Modbus TCP beetwen RPI and PLC and I also make init with "Modbus Slave Init" and the value was transfered to PLC. I try read holding register at 0x0000 and all status in codesys "device" is ok but why my value is always zero even though I change the value. I used another tool as Modbus TCP master but the value is good, could anyone help me for this problem?Attachment:MB_RPI.jpgRegardsRoy
