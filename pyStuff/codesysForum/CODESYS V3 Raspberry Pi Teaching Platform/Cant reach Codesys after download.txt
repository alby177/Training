Hey there,i`ve a problem with an xrdp connection to my raspberry Codesys System.I do an download to the Codesys Control with an xrdp serverbut after i Disconnect the Raspberry I cantreach the Codesys System animore.I can reach the Raspberry with a Remote Desktop control but not with Codesys.Does anyone know this problem or has anyone the same problemGreetings Torsten

Hi Thorsten,are you using current Version?Runtime 3.5.6.20?1.use 'top' via ssh Connection (putty) to check if the runtime is started.2. try do delete your bootapplication on the target via ssh (putty)How:sudo -scd /root/rm Application.*reboot the Pi then check if you see it again by scanning it in CODESYS:BREdwin

Hi,I have the same problem. After download, RPi is out of reach for codesys development - scanning can't find my RPi.I tried and deleted Application files as described. Did not help.I did some stopping and starting service. Code:sudo /etc/init.d/codesyscontrol start I see codesyscontrol takes 100% of CPU and after a minute or so service disapears (is obviously shut down). Then I also used  Code:sudo /etc/init.d/codesyscontrol stopI have purchased a licence and installed it (few weeks ago). I have a backup of licence in my computer.1) Attached is a log file.In start I see message it is running in demo mode!Then I seeQuote:1432959731: Cmp=CmpCodeMeter, Class=16, Error=1, Info=0, pszInfo= Error occurred activating license of ProductCode=01432959731: Cmp=CmpCodeMeter, Class=16, Error=1, Info=0, pszInfo= Error occurred activating license of ProductCode=603001at the end of file hundrets of messages: Quote:SysMemIsValidPointer[250]: Invalid pointer: 0x769d70002) Where is the location of restore folder to put in my backed-up licence file with winSCP?BR, Gregor

Hi Gregor,this is not a license problem,seems that your applciation I2C_Test_grega lead to a Crash.You could remove it by deleting in /root/ the file with the extention *.appThen restart the runtime,  it will not crash again.Then you need to solve the problem in the application (uncommend parts step by step till it does not crash again to figure out where the Problem is)For the restore of the license (which is not needed in that case, i'm almost sure - this demo message in the log is standard then it switch after a Minute to licensed) you find the restore directory under /root/restore.See my screenshot in case of a running pi you could use the CODESYS Filebrowser.BREDwin

Hi Edwin,deleting .app helped.It looks there was a problem because I enabled Watchdog (set as two times cyclic timer). in two tasks...Thank you.Gregor
