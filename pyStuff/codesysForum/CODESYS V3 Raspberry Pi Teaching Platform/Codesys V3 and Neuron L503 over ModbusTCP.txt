We are going to set up the new UniPi Neuron L503 under Codesys V3. After setting up the entire structure, we were able to load the program (under Codesys) onto the L503. Also, the program can be started without problems. - Now we wanted (or must) access the individual IN and OUT channels over ModbusTCP (this is also recommended by UniPi). - Unfortunately, at the moment we have no chance to build this communication.We were recommended to assign the IP address 127.0.0.1 on ModbusTCP slave. We are unsure that this is true.Is there anyone who has already gained experience with the new "Neuron" series, how to create the settings under Codesys to allow access to the I / O channels?Best thanks for your feedback
