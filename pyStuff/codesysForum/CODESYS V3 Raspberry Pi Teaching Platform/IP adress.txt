HelloJ begin to work with a Raspberry PI with CODESYS V3. It works very well.I use a DHCP server to bring an IP adress to my Raspberry. Is it possible to fix this adress, without the use of a DHCP server ?Maybe he should use linux commands, but I'm not an expert linux.   Thank you in advance for your response  

Hi,Some DHCP servers (like current FritzBox models) allow to set a fixed IP address for a specific computer (MAC address). This way, you should be able to solve the problem without touching the Linux running on the Raspberry Pi. Another advantage is that the IP address also stays fixed when you boot a different image on the Pi.HTH,Markus

Hi,if you want to change this setting in the Pi the following steps are needed:1. you need on windows 'putty' (google it - this is a program which allow to login via ssh to the pi)2. Login with putty to the pi  (you could find the current ip address in the plc logger in CODESYS)the login in for the Raspberry Pi pi raspberry (this is the default from the raspberry.org sd image)Then exeute:sudo nano /etc/network/Interfacesremove the lineiface eth0 inet dhcpand add the following linesiface eth0 inet static    address 192.168.xxx.xxx     netmask 255.255.255.0    gateway 192.168.xxx.1then Ctrl-o to save the changes, and ctrl-x to quit the Editorthensudo /etc/init.d/networking restartor simply reboot the pisudo rebootThat was it!Cheers Edwin

Thank you Edwin.It works well. But the command line seems to be case sensitive, if I write "sudo nano /etc/network/Interfaces", no file is found.If I write "sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces", the file is found, and I can modify it.  I still have some things to learn with linux   Thank you again  

thanks you're rightsudo nano /etc/network/interfacesis the right spelling...cuEdwin
