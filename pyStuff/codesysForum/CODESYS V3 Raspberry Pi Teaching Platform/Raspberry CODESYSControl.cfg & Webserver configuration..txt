Hi again.Where we can find info's for the parameters that accepted from CODESYSControl.cfg?Where we can find info's for the parameters of Webserver like port number max client number...?Regards

Hi,in /etc/CODESYSControl.cfg[CmpWebServer]WebServerPortNr=8080 the max num of Client you need to setup in CODESYS on the VisualisationManager 'Extended settings'client settingsMaxiumum number of Visualisation ClientsBREdwin

Is there any guide for the CodesysControl.cfg?

Hi,not really, this is covered by the manual which you get if you use a runtime toolkit which is not free of charge.Maybe we need to extract the config file part from that documentation if that is possible.BREdwin
