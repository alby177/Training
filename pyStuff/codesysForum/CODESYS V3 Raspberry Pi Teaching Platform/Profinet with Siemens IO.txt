Is anyone that can help with connection of Codesys Raspberry SL or Codesys Win SL and Siemens IM155-6 Profinet remote IO controller ?I am trying but when i scan for devices from Profinet master controller it found the remote IO controller but without Identification number or wrong number.I can put IP, Station name but nothing else.If i use the "profineta" configuration and diagnose software from Siemens in the same PC i can work all functionalities of remote IO.Waiting for help.Regards

Hi,did you install the device XML for this profinet slave to the device repository (this you should get from the device manufacturer)?BREdwin

I have install GSD file but the ptoblem i think is before this step because at scan for devices we have part responce.

could you add the screenshot of the scan result?BREdwin

Here we are.The IM155-6 remote IO is direct connected to PC.Regards

Hi,could you attach the Profinet GSDML.xml device description?BREdwin

This is.

OK I have news.When i made connection from local network i can see it with Scan for Devices and i can do inserting the devices in my project.I don't know why works like this and not in direct connection because Proneta software works same with direct or local network connection.But again the Remote IO bus not running as you can see.BR

Hi,there is an open point in our tracking database:The Workaround is to use attached (changed devdesc)BREdwin

Nothing change.

Hi,did you update your existing project by rightclick to the slave -> upate device (after installing this XML to the device repository?)or remove the the slave and reinsert by scan or by hand.BREdwin

I have delete the old GSD from repository and after i have installing yours.Then scan for device and reinserting.No deference.

Hi,then we need to check this error code in the Profinet Spec:BREdwin

Hi,another remark,could could you check if a sendclock with 4ms would solve the problem?BREdwin

I have do it before.Nothing change.

Response from Siemens Support:On the subject of the password STATION STATUS: DB810104To Development center where I referred for further analysis of your subject, tells us that the above code is not the Format of error messages generated by the IM 155-6 (It is in the form of text messages).We estimate that this code generated by the software whenever CODESYS advised to return to the third question to manufacturer.

Hi again.After install of new version Codesys 3.5.7.30 i can work with the modification of GSD file from you. Please tell me how can i work if i have different GSD files for different modules to use.Can i made the modifications by my self or i need to ask you for every new GSD file?Regards

Hi,let me check to which version this will be solved and how to apply the workaround.BREdwin
