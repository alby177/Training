Good afternoon,To which variable of EL2521 axis I have to put EL5101 encoder value tohave an axis in close loop mode?For the moment only moves in velocity.thanks, regardsIvan

Hi Ivan,I would use the available driver for thw EL2521But even if you use a Raspberry PI without realtime patch, this drivers might work, check with this Settings from the screenshot( & an enbaled DC)check this example:"c:\Program Files\3S CODESYS\CODESYS\Projects\SoftMotion\4.x.x.0\Examples\Tutorial\PosControl.project" BREdwin

Dear Edwin,thanks, it works.When is necessary if I use Softmotion with raspberry realtime patch?How could I know if my raspberry pi2 is in realtime? I am using EMLID realtime image.Raspberry Softmotion is compatible with CNC blocks?thanks, regards,Ivan

Hi,check the jitter in the taskmonitor, highes prio task should be <80us I would say for Raspberry PI is good enough...BREdwin
