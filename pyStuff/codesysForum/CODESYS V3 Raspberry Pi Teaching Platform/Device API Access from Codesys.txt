Hi All,I've embarked on a home automation project using Codesys on my Raspberry Pi 3 and have a key question regarding access device API from my PLC program.I've been using home automation devices for some time and currently I have a Samsung Smarthings hub with various devices connected to the hub over different protocols like: Z-Wave, Zigbee, WIFI. The hub takes status from all these devices and has a community of developers building smartapps that allows you build logic for Motion sensors, lighting, switches and so on. On its own its a very good home automation platform.I've used Codesys in industry as part of my work as an automation engineer so essentially I want to bypass the Smarthings Application and take the device status of all my existing connected devices and build my own logic and visualization.Doing research I have found a developer REST API that will give me access to all my Samsung Smarthings devices. It will give me access if I can make requests within my PLC program. This is something I don't have any experience with and hopefully someone can shed some light.I'm assuming over TCP I can make these requests but to implement this in a FB in codesys, I'm not sure where to start?. I will continue my research but If anyone has any experience accessing any device API through codesys this would be great.Thanks in advance all,Best Regards.

Hi,Sounds very interestingcould you give a small overview which devices exaclty'Samsung Smarthings hub with various devices connected to the hub' you are using?BREdwin
