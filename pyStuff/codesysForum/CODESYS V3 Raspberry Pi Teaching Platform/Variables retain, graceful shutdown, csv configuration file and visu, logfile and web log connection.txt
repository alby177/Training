Hi,I'm relatively new to CODESYS and Raspberry Pi controller.I'm using UniPi Neuron to implement an automation system.I need:when a specific external input signal goes to 1 I need to save some variables and when I'm sure file is completely written then I need to start a graceful shutdown of the system (Linux side). My questions are: How I can save and restore at startup those data? How to obtain a graceful shutdown in CODESYS after file write?to have a "configuration file", a file like a csv one in which I need to write some fixed data like set-points, setting values, strings and so on... I would like to have a visu page password protected through which with some input field I could input values directly by keyboard and after that via push button I need to save data in the csv file and restore data at startup of the entire systemto write a log file in append mode, essentially a text file which scope is to collect some events. My idea is to write a string (a row) in append mode and close the file handle avoiding the corrupt of the fileto connect to a remote server in such a way (for example http request) to send log data of the eventsThanks for support.

Hi,I would start to read here:https://help.codesys.com/webapp/_cds_va ... n=3.5.12.0basically this are Features of the runtime to save the retainfile... you only need to take care the the UPS workingand triggers the graceful shutdown.BREdwin

Ok for the retain functionality. I tested with success!
