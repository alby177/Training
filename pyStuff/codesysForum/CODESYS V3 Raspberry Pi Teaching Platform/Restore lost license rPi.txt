I recently updated/upgraded my rPi and forgot to back-up the license and subsequently lost it. How does one go about restoring a license?

Hi,write an email to the CODESYS support.BREdwin

I have a slightly different version of the same question:I have a license installed on a Pi, but I have screwed up something in the os that won't let me update to fix I2C driver issues.I can still connect to the Pi, and the runtime still runs fine, and I can see the license ID when I'm online.Is there a way to remove the license back to the repository so that I can rebuild the OS, and then move it back to the clean OS?  The remove license option is grayed out right now.Thanks in advance.

Hi,save the CMLicenseNew.WibuCmRaU file to your pc.This you could reactivate on this Pi after reinstalling the sd CardBREdwin

Thank you Edwin!
