Hey,I have connected Beckhoff BK9000 to raspberry via modbus tcp and everything works fine. But when I connect onewire temperature sensor ds18b20 to raspberry GPio pins modbus stops working, ds18b20 works fine and gives right values.What might be the reason for modbus tcp dropping out after ds18b20 connection?

Hi,you need to have for the Onewire an own Task. (and specify this Task in the OneWire IOMapping)Then it will work without influending the modbus taskBREdwin
