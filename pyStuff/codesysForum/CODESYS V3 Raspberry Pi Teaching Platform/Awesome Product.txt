I just wanted to say that this product is awesome.  I downloaded the image and booted up immediately to a fully functional CODESYS runtime.   I was able to connect right away and within 10 minutes, I had a web visualization server, Magelis HMI, and iPad all communicating and accessing data through symbol configuration.  I will be interested to see where this product develop might lead in the future.   I really appreciate that the team and 3S are realizing the potential of hardware platforms like this and are taking the right steps to support this side of the hardware platforms on the market.
