Hello everyone, I have to put in communication two RPI with Codesys.The two have to exchange some variables between them.What is the simplest and cheapest solution?Thankyou in advance   Serghei

hi,cheapest... -> none of them have extra costs every licenses included!The options are: Networkvariables (UDP) ProfinetController - Profinet Device Modbus TCP / Master - Slave Ethernet/IP Scanner and Adpater Netbase Services (see store example plc chat)BREdwin

Hi Edwin,Thankyou for the Answer   Ok i understand but if i want use ModBus TCP i need one Master License like this:[url]http://store.codesys.com/codesys-modbus-master-tcp.html[/url]And this license is included or no?!?!For me i understand is not included, then i need one for master and slave is included.Serghei
