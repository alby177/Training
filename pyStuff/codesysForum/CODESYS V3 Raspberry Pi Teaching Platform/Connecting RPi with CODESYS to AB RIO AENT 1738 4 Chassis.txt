Hello together,we've been playing a lot with the Raspberry Pi lately.We already got most of our Ethernet I/P devices connected.However, in order to use the RPi as fully functional PLC, we require 24V power I/O.Since we use AB components mostly, we would like to communicate with a AB RIO.EDS files can be found here: http://www.ab.com/networks/eds/cgi-bin/search.cgiWhen importing to CODESYS, it is stated that codesys doesn't support modular EDS files.Setting up a normal ENIP Adapter wasnt successful so far (wrong byte numbers probably).The RIO consists of a  ENIP Adapter/Base with two 16DI and one 16DO.Any ideas?
