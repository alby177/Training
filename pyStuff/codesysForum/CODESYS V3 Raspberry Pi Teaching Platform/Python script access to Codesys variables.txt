Hi,Is it possible to write a Python program/script to access the variables in the Codesys program?  I have searched the Python forum for a mention of Raspberry Pi and vice versa, but do not see any posts of the two together.  Is there a library or a way to access "SymbolFile" variables (like the standard version of Codesys)?I have a PiTFT touch screen from Adafruit: http://www.adafruit.com/product/1601.I would like to program it to be an HMI for the Codesys code, similar to the Web Visualization functionality.  I tried the web visu on the PiTFT screen but had some connection issues (asked about that on another topic already started).Thanks!Allen
