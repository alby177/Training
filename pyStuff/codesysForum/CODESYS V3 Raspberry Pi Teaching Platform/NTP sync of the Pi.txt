Hi!I'm not used to *unix, how do I enable NTP sync on the Pi?/U

It should normally sync by default using ntp but it needs an internet connection.If you installed using the image you downloaded from store you might have to adjust timezone though. Logon to the pi using console+keyboard or ssh client like putty. run, sudo raspi-config Select Internationalisation Options -> Change Timezone exit raspi-config and reboot.You could have a look at http://www.ronnutter.com/raspberry-pi-ntp-client-setup/ for some more info and configuration options.//Peter

Thanx, realised that the main problem was wrong gateway-setting ://U

hah...that one has bitten me once or twice as well  

If you have a GPS unit on your Pi you can even create a NTP Stratum 1 server. I havn't tried yet but I will.
