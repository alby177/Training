Hello,is there any modbus/TCP example with two Rasperry Pi ?Thank you in advanceBest RegardsLeonhard Stiegler

Hello,I'm lookig for same connection, do you have some new info about connesc 2 RPis via Modbus?Thank you.

Master Modbus1) Add device : Ethernet > Ethernet adapter2) Set ethernet adapter: Double click on it, set interface, IP ...3) Add device : Modbus > Modbus TCP Master4) Set Modbus Master device : Mark auto-reconnect5) Add device : Modbus > Modbus TCP Slave6) Set Modbus Slave device : General: Set Slave (2nd RPi) IP address, port, unit IDSlave Channel: Add channel (Reading -FC4 / Writing -FC16 / Both -FC23), set offset to 0x0000, set lengthAdd I/O mapping, I'm using full address to WORD, like "Application.PLC_PRG.modbusIn", where "modbusIn" are devined at PLC_PRG as "modbusIn	:	ARRAY [0..3] OF WORD;"7) Go to Device (CODESYS ...
