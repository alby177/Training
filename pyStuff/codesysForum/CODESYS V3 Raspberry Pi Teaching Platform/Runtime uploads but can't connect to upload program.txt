Hi There,So i have been using my Pi for weeks successfully uploading a controlling programme and webvisu, talking to my Arduino Mega as a Modbus TCP/IP slave and this has been perfect   . Then the other day Codesys just would not connect to the Pi. I can update the Runtime, this seems to load up to the pi, the Pi runs up to 25% on the CPU, the RX/TX lights on the Pi and the Arduino are flashing, but I when I type in the Pi's IP address in the Device section of codesys, it times out the first time, then I can't see the pi in the scan tree and just cannot connect or find the pi.I tried formatting my Pi and reinstalling Raspian but I am getting the same problem.Any ideas what could be wrong here?Thanks

Thank you so much for your help  It worked perfectly!
