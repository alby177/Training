Hello.I download mcp23017 library and install but I can,t add MCP23017 to I2c bus. I don,t have this element on "add device' list. What I,m doing wrong?

Hi,did you install the library and the device description?BREdwin

Thank You!That was the reason why I didnt have this on my list.By the way, how to change I2c speed?

Hi,one option is to change it here:sudo nano /etc/init.d/codesyscontrol..echo 400000 > /sys/module/i2c_bcm2708/parameters/Baudrate..BREdwinSure think you cold chance it outside from Linux command line too..
