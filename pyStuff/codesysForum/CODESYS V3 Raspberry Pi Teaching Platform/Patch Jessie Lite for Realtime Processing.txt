I have downloaded the official distribution and installed Jessie Lite on my Pi2 running headless.I would like to Patch Jessie Lite to have a Realtime kernel.If possible I would like to do the patch myself.Searching the web I found lots of references to patching Jessie (NOT Jessie Lite) using PREEMPT_RT.Does anyone know of a good resource outlining step by step guidance on how to do this?FWIW I am a Linux novice.

I would also be very interested in this!Thanks.

Someone have tried something ..... http://rnovitsky.blogspot.co.uk/2016/01/real-time-kernel-for-raspberrypi-2.html

I am using http://www.emlid.com/raspberry-pi-3-support-for-navio-is-here-2/ image , on my rpi 3 (image is also compatible woth rpi2)This is similar to the jesse lite.. see docs on their websiteFrom Github: "Real-time kernel for Raspberry PiThis repository holds a fork of Raspberry Pi Linux kernel patched with rt-patch and configured as a fully preemtible kernel. Instructions on compiling, setting up and testing the kernel are provided below."
