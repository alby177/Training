Hi guys,i have a problem with connection between codesys and raspberry. I'm using codesys with control for raspberry 3.5.10.20, and in rasberry there is RASPBIAN JESSIE WITH PIXEL Version:April 2017 Release date:2017-04-10 Kernel version:4.4. I'm using a demo version of raspberry license. If i try to do the raspberry update by menu tool, the raspberry will update without problem. When i try to download the project or to connect in the application page with enter the ip iddress of raspberry, doesn't work and poput appeare "No device responds to the scan request". It worked until a few days ago. I don't know what has changed. I tried to reinstall jessie on raspberry without success. The ssl connection with putty and ping to raspberry works. this is the codesyslog Linux version 4.4.50-v7+ (dc4@dc4-XPS13-9333) (gcc version 4.9.3 (crosstool-NG c                                           rosstool-ng-1.22.0-88-g8460611) ) #970 SMP Mon Feb 20 19:18:29 GMT 2017********* CoDeSysControl DEMO VERSION - runs 2 hours*********machine: armv7ltimer resolution: 1nsec=======================================================================1496251480: Cmp=CM, Class=1, Error=0, Info=4, pszInfo= CODESYS Control V31496251480: Cmp=CM, Class=1, Error=0, Info=5, pszInfo= Copyright (c) 3S - Smart                                            Software Solutions GmbH1496251480: Cmp=CM, Class=1, Error=0, Info=6, pszInfo= <version>3.5.10.20</versi                                           on> <builddate>Mar 13 2017</builddate>Can you help me to solve the problem? thank you

What happens when you just enter the correct IP address in the field and hit enter, without scanning for the pi? That usually works for me.Sent from my SM-G935F using Tapatalk

Doesn't found anything. Is crazy, 3 days ago it works..also in the raspberry update the scan Doesn't found raspberry, but if i enter the ip address manually the update works. But in the application label where are gateway  and device, doesn't found the rpi.

When I had that problem Codesys had an issue with another codesys version's gateway (Wago eCockpit). Is the gateway service running?Sent from my SM-G935F using Tapatalk

Hi,I would recommend to check by ssh:cat /tmp/codesyscontrol.logIf this is caused by an corrupt bootapplication / application crash in your applicaionyou could delete this by sudo -scd /root/PlcLogic/Applicationrm Application.*then restart the plc by/etc/init.c/codesyscontrol stop/etc/init.c/codesyscontrol startthis should solve it.Bye the way you could use the CODESYS Pi as Gateway:Add new GATEWAY in CODESYS with the IP Adress of your Pi.Switch to this new added Gateway and scan via this Pi Gateway, this works always, (and download is faster than just use the IPAdress on the right side of the communication dialog)BREdwin
