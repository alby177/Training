Hello,Any thoughts on making a version for the Raspberry Pi for the Programming environment?  I'm fine with the programming software on a PC, and then do a download to the Pi, but there is a large part of the Raspberry Pi crowd that actually would be interested in developing from the Pi itself - especially with the new Pi 2.  When I developed a product with Codesys Win RTE several years ago on the PC, I really liked having the development environment on the same PC as the runtime.  Are there any plans or thoughts on this at 3S for the Pi?  I think this would be really great if your debating it.  Even if you could come up with a solution to run it in Mono, or Docker or something, this would be great.Thanks in advance.
