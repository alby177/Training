Hello everybody,I am creating a library in which I have several folders containing POUs.Is there a way to hide/show folder of this library when the library is added in a project file.I would like not to see some folders of the library in the library manager of the .project file.Thanks for your answers

Hi,Thank you for your response. I have already tried what you suggest.. but it doesn't work.I don't think it's possible to hide a folder even if it doesn't include any POUs..
