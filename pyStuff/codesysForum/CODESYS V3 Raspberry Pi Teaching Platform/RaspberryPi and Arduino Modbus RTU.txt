Hi everyone,I'm using the following setup:- Raspberrry Pi 3 as Modbus RTU Master (MODBUS_COM_Port_1)- Arduino UNO as Modbus RTU Slaveboth are connected via USBI use ModbusSerial library for Arduino from here:https://github.com/andresarmento/modbus ... /librariesI tested the Arduino with qModMaster on my Windows-PC via USB port. This worked well as you can see in the screenshots. Therefore I assume that the Arduino setup and code are correct.Further, I also assigned the RaspberryPi USB Com Port described here:viewtopic.php?f=21&t=6755&p=14284&hilit=modbus+rtu#p14284But as you can see in the screenshot, the Modbus slave is not running (red triangle) and status of Modbus Slave is 'Bus error'. Thank you for your help!rKtiC

HiI used this codesudo nano /etc/CODESYSControl.cfg [SysCom]Linux.Devicefile=/dev/ttyUSBportnum := COM.SysCom.SYS_COMPORT1;sudo /etc/init.d/codesyscontrol restarttry italso make sure that in the point of updating the variables you have a mode (always in the task of the bus cycle) number 2.But this will not be the only problem with the modbus rtuAfter the reboot, you will have a loss of communication between Arduino and RaspberryI have not been able to solve this problem yet.If you find solutions please let me knowGood luck

I added this.[SysCom]Linux.Devicefile=/dev/ttyACMThere is some command to see the name of the com port but I can't remember. In my case it wasn't ttyUSB.I also didn't need to add "portnum := COM.SysCom.SYS_COMPORT1;"/Martin
