Hi,I need to configure my Raspberry Pi, that handle valves and controls, as a TCP Modbus Slave.The problem is that the application is a porting of another application and for compatibility I need to leave the same Modbus registers.I need to configure an array of 600 elements of DINT contiguous, another area configured like array of 600 elements of REAL, a 600 bit array area and some other bits distributed in different other areas.I have configured the system as the following image illustrates...I have the following questions:[*] the controller can act at the same time as a master and as a client in Modbus TCP?[*] how can I set the right Modbus area to be available exactly as previous ones? For me isn't so clear the area configuration in the left side of the configuration Modbus windows. I checked the "Modbus TCP Slave Device I/O Mapping" but is not clear for me how to proceed to configure addresses I need.Thanks
