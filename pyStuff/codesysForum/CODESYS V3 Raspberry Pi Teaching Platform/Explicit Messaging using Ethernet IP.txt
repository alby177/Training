Hello,I am using stepper drive that "supports Explicit Messaging using either a Class 3 connection or the Unconnected Message Manager (UCMM)". I had success to communicate with this drive using UDP, but can't figure out how to send and receive messages over Ethernet/IP using class 3 connection. I found IIoDrvEIPAcyclicServicesLibrary in Library Manager that has IoDrvOpenClass3Connection and IoDrvSendClass3ConnectedMessage methods, but it is part of interface and I don't know how I can implement it and use it. Do you have any suggestions?Thank you!

Hi,there is an example application in our CODEYSYS store for this:http://store.codesys.com/ethernet-ip-se ... ample.htmlBREdwin

I know about this example and I used it to get access to AssemblyObject class to read IO status of my drive. May be I am missing a point, but it looks for me that example is for common services (like setAttribute, getAttribute, Start, Stop, etc). In my case I have vendor specific profile with service code 0x3C and the class code is 0x64. I can enter class code in the function block even if it is not standard, but I don't understand how to use service code. IIoDrvEIPAcyclicServicesLibrary with IoDrvOpenClass3Connection and IoDrvSendClass3ConnectedMessage methods is exactly what I needed (it has structure with service code, class code, Instance and Attribute), but yesterday I found out that that library is for Hilscher card only. Thank you!
