I am working on a project which I need to send GPIO commands very fast. Is it possible to speedup the GPIO read/write? E.g using WiringPi library rather than using sysfs or /dev/memWhat are the current way codesys interact with GPIO and is there any way to improve its speed?

Hi,how fast do you expect it?At the Moment it depends on how fast you setup your taskcycle.BREdwin
