HiI wanted to produce a simple HMI program on a PI 3 with a 7" touch screen on it. I need this to pull and push data from/to the HMI from a Siemens s7-315 that has an ethernet card Lean 1 card on the rack. Can someone point me in the direction of how I can get the data to and from this PLC to the RPI 3 with codesys HMI on it.Thanks for any assistance.

Hi,the Pi3 could act as Profinet Controller or Profinet Device...!This could be the communication between S7 and CODSYS PI.BREdwin

Thanks for the reply. Could you direct me to some specific instructions for this to get me started on how to set this up.

Hi,I would give this example here atry, both sides are in PN Controller and PN Device.viewtopic.php?f=23&t=6247BREdwin
