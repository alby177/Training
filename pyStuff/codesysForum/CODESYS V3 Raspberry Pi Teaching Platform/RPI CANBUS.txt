Hello,I have a problem with the rts_set_baud.sh script.Attachment:Codesys error.jpgI donâ€™t understand, the script is at rootAttachment:locate script.jpgHave you an solution ?Attachment:droit script.jpgthksDavid

Hi,I would recommend to check how this is done in beaglebone blackthere the can is supported.BREdwin

Ok thanks for your advice.But the canbus is no longer supported on the RPI?

Hi,we just add all needed components to the runtime (obviously without this script)As you need anyway to build a customized kernel with included socketcan (or is this nowadays not needed anymore?)At that time we decide just add the license for the users which manage to deal with restricitions.BREdwin

I think i don't need a specfic kernel.My application requires just CANBUS with sofmotion light for 3 axis.My can RPI canboard is avaible but codesys script is disable.

I have find a solution to done the canBus.I use a RaspiLC Iso:Raspbian Jessie-Desktop Kernel 4.9 Codesys-Runtime 3.5.11But now i have this: Module not foundAttachment:Driver not found.jpg
