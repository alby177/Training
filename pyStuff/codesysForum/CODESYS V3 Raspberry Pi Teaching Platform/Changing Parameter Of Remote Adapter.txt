Hi! If you open remote adapter (in my case I have Ethernet/IP adapter) in watch window we see all kinds of parameters.Attachment:Capture10.PNGI recognize first 5 of them, but I don't understand idea behind presenting the rest of them. They all have prefix "_" in front of them. Can I change them from program or not? What the purpose of them under RemoteAdapter?I am interested particularly in udiIPAddress under _strTCPIPConfiguration. Attachment:Capture11.PNGIf I select this parameter and use Copy from context menu I am getting expression Device.Application.IoConfig_Globals.AB_PLC._cipTCPIPInterface._strTCPIPConfiguration.udiIPAddress. AB_PLC is my remote adapter that I have in Devices tree. I can easily force this parameter to another value when I am online and it keeps this value after I remove force. Attachment:Capture12.PNGAttachment:Capture13.PNGIf I try to use something like this "AB_PLC._cipTCPIPInterface._strTCPIPConfiguration.udiIPAddress:=16#C0A8020C;" in my program it gives me compile errors                 C0037:  '_cipTCPIPInterface' is no input of 'RemoteAdapter'C0037:  '_strTCPIPConfiguration' is no input of 'TCPIP_Interface'What am I doing wrong?My guess was, if I could easily change/force parameter online from Codesys then I could change it also from program during run time. How to access these parameters correctly?Thank you!Vitali

Hi Vitali,this is not implemented but will come to 3.5SP11 release (mid of July)BREdwin

Edwin,Thank you for reply!Can't wait... You can count on me if you need beta testers.  Vitali
