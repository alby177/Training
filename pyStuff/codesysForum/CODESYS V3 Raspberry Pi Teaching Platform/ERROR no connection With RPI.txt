Hi,did you use these steps to install the package and CODESYS?https://faq.codesys.com/display/CDSFAQ/Raspberry+-+FAQIf yes you could even add the 'update command' to the menubar. (Tools->Customize-add Command)BREdwin

I made some progress. I changed the network settings and enabled SSH. I can ping the raspberry and install the runtime on it, but Codesys does not find the device.

Hi,You have always 3 posibilities to connect to the PI:1. Use the Gateway running on your CODESYS pc and scan the pi (usually this is the most used, this is what you have probably tried - and obviously fails)2. you could add a new Gateway in CODESSYS with the IP address of the Raspberry PI (there is a Gateway embedded in the PI plc)   use/switch to this Gateway to scan the PI. (This is what I suggest to do in your case to solve your problem)3. Add the ipaddress of the Pi on the right side (comunication Window in CODESYS) and connect that way to your PIBREdwin
