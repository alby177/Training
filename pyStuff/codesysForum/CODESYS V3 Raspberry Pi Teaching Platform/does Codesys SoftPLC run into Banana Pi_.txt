I already have a raspberry pi B model and I'd like to buy a Banana Pi (just for try, it seems to be more powerful)..but question is: can I run the Codesys softPLC on it? it should be compatible..

Hi,no banana pi is not supported at the moment, till now,there are no plans to support the banana pi.BREdwin

Thanks Edwin,then I'll not buy
