Is it possible to set a "Value" entry on the "GPIO Parameters" tab to a fixed value?I would for instance like to use GPIO4 only as an input and never as an output.I can set the default value, and limit the possibilities of the Value field to "Input" but I still have toset the (only possible) value in the configuration.Is it possible to skip or inhibit bit field entries on the "GPIOs I/O Mapping" tab?Since GPIO 0 till 3 can not be used, it's useless to be able to assign a variable to it.So I would like to inhibit those fields somehow (only when using BIT entries, not if thebit is part of e.g. a Word, then the programmer is responsible to handle the bits properly).Regards,Ruud
