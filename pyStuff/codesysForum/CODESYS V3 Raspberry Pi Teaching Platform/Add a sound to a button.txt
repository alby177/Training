Hi,check this example in the Forum application examples/snippets:viewtopic.php?f=23&t=6247You could add the sound file as external file in CODESYS (it will be downloaded then by CODESYS to the plc) and then execute it by the command linelike shown in this example.(This you Need to do in an own Task, because the Task is blocked as Long the sound file is played)Keep in mind this solution does play the sound on the PI, not on the _/webvisu where you press the button.BREdwin
