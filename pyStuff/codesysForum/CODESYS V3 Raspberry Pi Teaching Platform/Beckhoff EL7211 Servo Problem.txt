One of them is DS402 profile other one ise MDP742 profile. In default EL7211 servodriver comes with MDP742 profile. But unfortunately, Codesys SM functions cannot work with MDP742 profile. You have to change profine in Twincat software. After changing MDP742 profile to DS402 profile everything can work.
