Dear allSPI master is not working any more after installing the latest raspbian-2017-12-01. It runs perfectly well with previous version (https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspb ... 017-09-08/ kernel 4.9.41-v7+).It seems that the SPI kernel 4.9.59-v7+ interface has changed in RPi side creating the need for a change in CODESYS run time. Something to do with clock divider, maybe. I tried setting SPI master parameter _dMaxSpeed to several different values, no effect.I have tested with Piface OI driver, but all hardware using SPI interface would be affected and that is why I would like to 3S personal to take measures.ThanksL.P.Laus

Hi,yes, the workaround is to reduce the SPI maxspeed inthe CODESYS configuration.BREdwin

HiI have tried it, but it did not work. Even reloading the application. Any additional hint?

Hi,I use:- PI3 & PIFACE- Version 3.5.12.10 CODESYS and Raspberry PI runtime- Rasbian Stretch from 11-29-2017- enable the SPI under raspi-config- specify the maxspeed to 100000 in the CODESYS Project (PIFace IOdriver exampe)this works for me! BREdwin
