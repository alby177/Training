Hi,there is a problem if you try to use the Ethercat Example with Pi Model B+ and WLanstickto login. (Sure this work with Model B)If you start the CODESYS project immediately wlan/wifi get disconnected ... !We are currently investigating this , B+ seems to have a new Networkchip and a new USB implementation whichseems to be the reason for this.I guess this is not CODESYS related.. if anyone has found a solution this would be great.Give you new information as soon we found a solution for this, probably a workaround could be to use a Lan/USB adapterbut even this should be verified.BREdwin

Hi all,maybe this is the solution:http://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/qu ... d-ethernetto be verified.BREdwin

Hi,now I found the time to verify this,for me the solution of the link works.1. change /etc/default/ifplugdsudo nano /etc/default/ifplugd INTERFACES="eth0"HOTPLUG_INTERFACES="eth0"ARGS="-q -f -u0 -d10 -w -I"SUSPEND_ACTION="stop"2. then reboot3. after reboot you need tosudo ifplugd eth0 --kill(proposal is to do that later in rc.local)After that even if wlan is connected and we start ethercat on eth0 or connect disconnect eth0in my case it works. (not disconnection on wlan happens now)BREdwin

Hi,I've a mini usb wifi modul with RTL8192cu chipset.I'd like to use:-eth0 for EtherCAT master-wlan0 as access point for programming codesys RPi.Please help me how to set interfaces, drivers, wpa.. so on.Thank you!BRFrancesco

Hello Edwin,your suggestion worked fine for my RPi B+.But when I creat a boot application, after reboot the wifi connection just drops out as soon as my application starts.Seems like "sudo ifplugd eth0 --kill" has to be done after every reboot.Are there any updates on this topic or further ways around this problem.Thank you!Best regards,Oleg
