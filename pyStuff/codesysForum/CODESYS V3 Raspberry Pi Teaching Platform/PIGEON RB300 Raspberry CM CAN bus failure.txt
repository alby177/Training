Hi,We have been working for almost 2 years with Beagleboneblack in industrial environments for motion control with great results. We are going to use other boards along with the BBB ones for our projects.We are now developing new projects with the Pigeon RB300 board (Raspberry Computer Module) but we stumbled on the CAN Bus Failure.The can0 interface is working properly since i can send/receive frames on the bus through the cansend/candump commands.The Codesys Log reports this error: 'cannot execute ./rts_set_baud.sh - can0 will not work' (see attached pictures).I followed the steps in this old post : https://forum.codesys.com/viewtopic.php?f=21&t=5611&start=30 I created and saved this file in /root, / and /home/pi but codesys seems not finding it. The file has all permissions (+rwx for all users).Even if i set the baud by hand throughCode:sudo ip link set can0 up type can bitrate 125000sudo ifconfig can0 upI always get can bus failure.Thank you.

Modify the CODESYS configuration file /etc/CODESYScontrol_User.cfg:Code:[SysCom];Linux.Devicefile=/dev/ttyS[CmpBlkDrvCom];Com.0.Name=MyCom;Com.0.Baudrate=115200;Com.0.Port=3;Com.0.EnableAutoAddressing=1[CmpSocketCanDrv]ScriptPath=/opt/codesys/scripts/ScriptName=rts_set_baud.sh[SysProcess]Command.0=shutdown[CmpApp]Bootproject.RetainMismatch.Init=1Application.1=PIGEON_CANmasteradd the bash script /opt/codesys/scripts/rts_set_baud.shCode:#!/bin/shBITRATE=`expr $2 \\* 1000`ifconfig $1 downecho ip link set $1 type can bitrate $BITRATEip link set $1 type can bitrate $BITRATEifconfig $1 upthen modify the permissions:Code:sudo chmod +x /opt/codesys/scripts/rts_set_baud.sh

Thank you very much Kristech,It's working like a charm now.
