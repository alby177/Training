I am using the VisuSerialCom example project - albeit altered - to read an integer from an Arduino, which sends it every second as a high and low byte in order.I've edited the project to receive the data as an array of 1 int and it displays properly.  That integer is a base number plus a randomization band (i.e. 6000 + random number between -100 and +100), hence the update every second is important to capture the most recent value.The problem I run into is this:  After running for a while, the number reads suffer from very severe lag.  I can force the Arduino output to zero manually and observe that change immediately on an attached 7-segment display as well as on an oscilloscope. I left the program running for 12 hours and the lag is now at about 25 minutes.  So I force a change to zero, and the Raspberry Pi with the modified VisuSerialCom project still updates the number once every second, but it will take about 25 minutes of 1-second updates before the value goes to zero.What should I be looking at to fix this?  Perhaps forcibly flush the readBuffer after every read?  (How do I do that?)Thanks for any help,Matt

For what it is worth, the delay in the read block is set to 1000 ms.  The Arduino writes a new value to its serial port every 1000 ms.

Never mind - I think the problem is gone now.  I reduced the read delay from 1000 ms to 250 ms and the delay appears gone, even after running the application for two hours.
