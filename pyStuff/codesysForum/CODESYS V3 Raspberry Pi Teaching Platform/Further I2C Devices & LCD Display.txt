In some of the upcoming releases will the I be able to add this current sensing device under the I2C branch?I already have it working stand-alone on the RPi but would I be able to interface it into the CODESYS software?LINK:(http://www.adafruit.com/products/904#Description)Also, 4D systems develop some very clever LCD displays that run on the Pi.Again, I've been able to get it communicating fully with the RPi however it runs on a C Program. I'm new to the software so I don't know if I'm able to integrate an already running C program to "interrupt" the CODESYS main sequence and do something else when the touch screen is pressed (IE: send a modbus tcp command to my IO controller to switch a relay etc..)Many thanks,Sean.

Hi Sean,guess we will add a description (hope for the next release) how to add such I2C devices and give library and devicedescription example,this should give all users the posibility to add every I2C device which is available. (Think we could not do this for all)For now, I've attached the AdafruitPWM I2C device which should show you how to add it.For your lcd device, we need to check what is possible.Not sure at the moment.BREdwin
