Hi All,I have a problem where the localhost visualization on my RPI_3 comes up with the "An error occurred; will restart automatically".I then checked the PLC log and found "Error occurred activating license of ProductCode=603001".Attachment:PLC_LOG.pngWhen I check under PLC Settings I see that the licence is in deed installed.Attachment:RPI_LIC.pngIts strange because when I restart the RPI3 and then check the PLC Log, it says than the runtime licence is valid.Although the Visualization on the local host isnt working I can still log in with codesys and manipulate the variables, which tells me that the application is still running on the Raspberry PI.Please check my attached PLC LOG and I would appreciate any help on the subject.
