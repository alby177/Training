Hello.Edwin, codesys use 1217 TCP port, i´m sure UDP not work.Please help me to program my raspbery plc in remote.Bes regards.

if you use the remote Gateway which is embedded in theCODESYS plc... UDP 1217 .Please try it. Add the Ip of your remote reachable Pi - then use this Gateway to scan your remote Network and you will see the PI plcthere.BREdwin
