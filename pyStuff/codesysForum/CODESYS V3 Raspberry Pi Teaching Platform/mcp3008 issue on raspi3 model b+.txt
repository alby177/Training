Hi i have a last problem witrh mcp3008:i wired 2 mcp 3008 the first with chip select on pin 26, the second with chip select on pin 24.I set 2 spi master , the first on /dev/spidev0.0, the second on /dev/spidev0.1.It works, but when the two are wired, it seems adding the 2 values on the same input mcp3008.auiValue[0], with the mcp3008_1.auiValue[0].Have i proceed in the wrong way ?Thanks Thierry
