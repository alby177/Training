Hello,Is the A+ supported?

Hi,at the moment not, there is no ethernet onboard and we have no requests to support ittill now.BREdwin

I would use the a USB hub and wireless ethernet with this.

Good afternoon!I join a question about the support of A +.Model A + works fine through USB-Ethernet adapter. Photos are attached.After starting the system while it's OK.But after approximately a minute process codesyscontrol.bin  loaded CPU to 100 percent. Also photos are attached.And all versions of the runtime behave identically.Is it possible to add support for this wonderful module?Best Regards, Michael.

Hi,we need to add A+ Support in the runtime to solve this.I have ordered a device we will do this.BREdwin

That is great!  I had exactly the same issue.  It worked fine for about a minute.  I had it working with just a wireless dongle also.

Is the support for Raspberry Pi  A+ available in the newest Codesys version? Unfortunately i still have above problem
