Hi,I update my raspberry pi and receive an error[ERROR]         Error output: codesyscontrol.bin: no process found insserv: script codesyscontrol is not an executable regular file, skipped! I don't know what this is about and it may be causing an issue with my program.Thanks.

Hi,guess not, just check if codesyscontrol is available if you execute 'top' in the linuxshellYou could call systeminfo in the update tool too.BREdwin
