Hello, I'm currently work on a project and I want to display dynamic images. My problem is that I need the same image several times but I don't know how much, it depend of the utility (it can be 4 or 100!) So, I would like to instanciate an image rather than create 100 images on my application. Is it possible to instanciate an image from the programming?Thank you for you help!

Hi,Currently there is no way to create and include the VisuElements dynamically.You have to define the maximum configuration and switch the unused elements invisible.BREdwin

Ok thank you for you quick answer. I will do that so.Best Regards
