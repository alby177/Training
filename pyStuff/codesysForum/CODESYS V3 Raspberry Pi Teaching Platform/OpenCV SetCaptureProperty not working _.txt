Hello happy people,I'm trying to use OpenCV with CODESYS but I can't change the capture size from a USB camera (not using the piCam).I modified the OpenCV example like this :Code:// Open cameraCamera_for_OpenCV(xExecute := NOT xDoneCamera, xDone => xDoneCamera);IF Camera_for_OpenCV.pCapture = 0 THEN   RETURN;END_IF//*************************************************************// TRY SMALLER IMAGE : property 3 = WIDTHCmpOpenCV.cvSetCaptureProperty(Camera_for_OpenCV.pCapture, 3, 320);//*************************************************************// Get image from camera.pImgCam := CmpOpenCV.cvQueryFrame(capture := Camera_for_OpenCV.pCapture);But it looks like the SetCaptureProperty is simply ignored. When I llok the webvisu it is still in 640x480, and in the program the pImgCam is also 640x480.Side note : if I try with property 4 : HEIGHT, the codesyscontrol crashes.I tried the FBD and the ST program, but no luck in either cases.I even tried to reduce the image display on the visualization, but it didn't work.Does someone know how to change the capture size from a camera in OpenCV+CODESYS ?
