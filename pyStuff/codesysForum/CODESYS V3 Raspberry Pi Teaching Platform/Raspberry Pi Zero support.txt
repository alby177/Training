Hello,There is any plan to support new Raspberry Pi Zero?Thank you.

Hi,yes if we get one... think next release it should be in.Update: At the moment not sure if and when supported!BREdwin

Hi,after a more detailed look to the Raspbery Pi Zero we decided not to support this derivative.The board has only two MicroUSB-Ports, one of it is used for the power supply, the other one for the programming Interface. Furthermore the GPIOs are not available without additional effort. Thus the commercial advantage does really make it worth to spend the technical effort.

Hi,It is very dissapointing.Will Codesys be supported by Raspberry Compute module or Model A+?Thank you.

By the way,beside the Raspberry Pi Zero the Raspberry Pi 1 Model A+ and the Compute Module are NOT supported neither.This means that CODESYS Control for Raspberry Pi SL will not run on these devices.Thank you for your understanding!

there is an update on this:with 3.5SP11 (July) the whole Pi family will be supportedincluding:Compute Module 1Compute Module 3Compute Module 3 litePi ZeroPi Zero WlanPi Model A+BREdwin

This is great news!Thank you 3S!

I was going to ask this about the Compute module and the Zero wireless, and I saw that its coming out in July in sp11..SWEEET!  My head is spinning thinking about a little rover with 3 or 4 Zero Wireless boards communicating via Netvars over wireless with an onboard mini router..

Since the Compute Module will soon be supported, does that mean that Codesys could be running on a Kunbus Revolution Pi?

Hi,probably these two core types should work with CODESYS 3.5SP11 (did not have the chance to test it)but I guess the additional I/O MODULE will not work out of the box / adding Drivers whatever is needed.BREdwin
