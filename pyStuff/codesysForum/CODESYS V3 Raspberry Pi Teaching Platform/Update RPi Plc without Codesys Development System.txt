Hello,I have several RPi running Codesys and I would like to know if I could update my PLC software (running with codesyscontrol service) without the Codesys Development System on my working station.The idea is to run a shell script on the RPi that stop codesyscontrol, then it could copy some files to change the PLC software (or something else) and then restart codesyscontrol service.Is it possible?Best regards,Vincent

Yes, it is possible. You need something like this:Code:#!/bin/bashCURRDIR=`dirname $0`systemctl stop codesyscontrolwhile kill -0 `pidof codesyscontrol` 2> /dev/null; do sleep 1; donefor dir in /var/opt/codesys//PlcLogic/*; do    [ -z "${dir##*trend*}" ] && continue    rm -rf "$dir"doneif [ -f $CURRDIR/PlcLogic.zip ]; then unzip $CURRDIR/PlcLogic.zip -qo -d /var/opt/codesys; fisyncsystemctl start codesyscontrolPlcLogic.zip created manually using Codesys (save boot application).

Hi,why not just use the official way to do this?sudo dpkg -i codesyscontrol_arm_raspberry_V3.5.12.0.dewill update the plc runtime Version and bootprojekt runs imidiately in the new version... if already on the system running before the updateTo update your application means-> update the content of /var/opt/codesys/PlcLogic/ (which are the application files)BREdwin

Hey,Sorry for the delay and but thank you for your answer.I will try it soon when I have the opportunity.Vincent

Hi ViacheslavNice Script, but how do you save the boot project as a PlcLogic.zip file.I can only save the file as a Application.app file which I can not open as a zip-file ???I am doing as discribed in the online help.Best regards.Peter
