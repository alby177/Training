HiI'm wanting to create communications between two raspberry pi using EtherNet/IP protocol (one adaptor, one scanner). This should be possible ? However when i try to add device, its really difficult to see the devices which i can select. See attached picture. The scroll window is very small. Any tips for a novice.Thanksp.s i'm running V3.5 SP8 Patch1+

Hi,yes but could arange this as you need it.BREdwin

thanks Edwin. Thats a bit embarrassing !

Hi All,I've got two RPi's running. In 1st picture below is Pi1 (which is the scanner). I've set the ip address of the scanner in "Ethernet (Ethernet)". Under "Generic_EtherNet_IP_device" I have setup the ip of the adaptor (which is Pi2). You see the error I am getting.Attachment:Capture.PNG.Attachment:Capture3.PNGIn the 3rd picture is the connection settings. I followed example on YouTube of RPi to wago setup. 1 byte in and 1 byte out.Attachment:Capture1.PNGIn 4th picture is the setup on the Pi2 (adaptor). I was not 100% sure on its configuration. I added an adaptor and two EtherNet_IP_Module's (no scanner here). One configured as Byte Input Module and the other as Byte Output module to match the scanner setup on pi1.Attachment:Capture2.PNGThanks for any tips !

I got it to work eventually. I opened the CODESYS_EtherNetIP_Adapter.eds in text editor and copied the connection path out of iti.eAttachment:Capture5PNG.PNGHere is the connection path settingsAttachment:Capture4.PNGnote: in youtube video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrV7laAJkDk, there is a checkbox "predefined connection (EDS file)" in the connection path settings. I do not have this.Is there an easier way than opening eds file in txt editor ?Thanks
