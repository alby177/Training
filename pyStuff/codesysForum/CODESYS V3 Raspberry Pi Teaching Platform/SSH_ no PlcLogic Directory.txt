Hello,in my SSH I cannot find PlcLogic dir.But in the CODESYS IDE in can see that this directory exists.Any ideas?I sometimes need to delete the Bootproject when CoDeSys loses connection with runtime.Best regards,Oleg

Hi Oleg,you could delete the bootproject by using the Update tool.Since 3.5SP11 release the runtime Directory is:/var/opt/codesys/so you'll find PlcLogic here:/var/opt/codesys/PlcLogic/BREdwin

Thank You!
