I am looking for a tutorial on how to configure a Pi3 to use Canbus through an MCP2515. Is there any available?

anyone?

Using the candump command, I am able to see the network Packets.However, I am still getting a bus failure in codesys

I seem to be getting errors from the following script:sudo /root/rts_set_baud.sh#!/bin/shBITRATE=`expr $2 \\* 1000`ifconfig $1 downecho ip link set $1 type can bitrate $BITRATEip link set $1 type can bitrate $BITRATEifconfig $1 up

Edwin? Can you help?

Hi,I'm having the same problem ... Do you know more about that ?Best Regards

Create rts_set_baud.sh file in /root/ and chmod it to 777.
