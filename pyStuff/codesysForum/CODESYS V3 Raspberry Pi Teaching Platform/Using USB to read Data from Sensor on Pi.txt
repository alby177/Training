Hello,is it possible to read the data from an external USB Sensor on CODESYS?Like: sudo socat /dev/ttyUSB1,b9600 STDOUTThe command line will prdouce the following.$1;1;;;- 0,9;;;17,6;;;;;75;;;59;;;;;;;;;0 I want to read these Data directly in CODESYS from a weather station (USB from ELV) to control further devices an show the Data in a webViusu.Thanks for your helpMatthias

Hi Matthias,please try my attached project.I've connected a usb to serial adapter, send via a windows terminal programm 'READ_USB' thenyou execute the bREAD which get the data from char device.This should work for your device too.BREdwin

Hi,i used your solution in this topic:viewtopic.php?f=21&t=5699&hilit=serialThis works well for me Thanks for your support!

Hi,yes sure for serial communication this works,in case you have any other char device under Linux - the example might be the choice.BREdwin

Hi Edwin,Could you help me, please? I'm newbie in RaspBerry and in Codesys too, so trying to reading RS232 by RS232 to USB adapter when I open your example in CoDeSys V3.5 SP6 Patch3 I get the following errors:Identifier 'CMPCHARDEVICE.RTS_IEC_HANDLE' not definedidentifer 'CmpCharDevice' not definedMy RaspBerry is PI 2 Model BMax

Hi,whenever you open an older project the procedure is the following:1. Rightclick on the plc device in the device tree -> update deviceIn the projectsettings:2.- use current Compiler Version3.- use current visuprofilethis should solve these Problems (usually an older library is missing because in the old plc device the placeholder points to a not installed library version)This should solve it.BREdwin

Hi,many many thanks, works perfectly?BSMax
