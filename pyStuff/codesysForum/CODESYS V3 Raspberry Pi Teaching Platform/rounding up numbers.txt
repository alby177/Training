Hi all,Probably a stupid question but i have some troubles with rounding up numbers. So just like 3/2 = 2It Always has to be rounded to the biggest number. Any suggestions here?  (i don't use the oscat library)Many thanks.

So what do you want ?If you want to be see 3/2 = 1.5 you have to define LREAL variable.For example,variable1 : LREAL;variable1 := 3/2;so, you can see variable1 = 1.5

There are many ways to always round up, but here is one:Code:RVal = REAL(3)/2;IVal = INT(3/2);If RVal > INT_TO_REAL(IVal) THEN   IVal := IVal + 1;END_IF

a/b+((a div b)+(b-1))/b
