Hej.Im running a small experiment with raspberry/webvisu. Im having a problem that webvisu is interrupted every minute with "an error occurred, reloading", tried several different settings but no luck. Running raspberry Jessie, epiphany browser.//P

Hallo,which versions are you using and which Pi type?PiB+, Pi2, Pi3?Till now I have seen this only on PiB/PiB+ this is more a perfomance Issue.All others work preatty well.BREdwin

Dear Edwin.Im running pi 2, model B, purchased a month ago. I have to correct myself in first post, the exact error message is : "an error happened will automatically restart"//P

Hi,this should work with Pi2!please check the plc logger for more information.If this does not give more Information, remove item by item from visu until you see which graphic or item is responsible for the non working webvisu.I had some cases where a svg in a specific Format does cause such problems.BREdwin

ok, will do. The visu is minimalistic, couple of rocker switches and a bar graph. Ill be back =0) .

Hej.Im confused, I removed everything in my visu so only visu remaining now is a grey rectangle but still same error. Looking at log I cant figure out what is happening. I have as of yet not purchased the license so running on the 120 minute test window, when I get it all working and verified performance of raspi is ok I will buy the license. PLC log shows no errors, only info, below log is looped over and over again, I can see client is removed and created :"information" component="IECVisualization" user="nobody" timestamp="2016-02-26 06:31:07" infoId="0"VisuFctCheckForUnusedClients: Successfully Removed Client at Address: 3063131664, IEC-ID was: 3"information" component="IECVisualization" user="nobody" timestamp="2016-02-26 06:31:07" infoId="0">VisuFctCheckForUnusedClients: Removing Client at Address: 3063131664"debug" component="IECVisualization" user="nobody" timestamp="2016-02-26 06:31:07" infoId="0">Visu_PRG: Address of client with IEC-ID 2 : 3063074764"information" component="IECVisualization" user="nobody" timestamp="2016-02-26 06:31:07" infoId="0">Visu_PRG: Creating Client successful for Extern-ID: 28083 Returned IEC-ID: 2"information" component="IECVisualization" user="nobody" timestamp="2016-02-26 06:31:07" infoId="0">Visu_PRG: Creating Client for Extern-ID: 28083"information" component="CmpWebServer" user="nobody" timestamp="2016-02-26 06:31:06" infoId="0">State: successful"information" component="CmpWebServer" user="nobody" timestamp="2016-02-26 06:31:06" infoId="0">File &lt;file&gt;/application.imagepoolcollection.csv&lt;/file&gt; requested ..."information" component="CmpWebServer" user="nobody" timestamp="2016-02-26 06:31:06" infoId="0">State: successful"information" component="CmpWebServer" user="nobody" timestamp="2016-02-26 06:31:06" infoId="0">File &lt;file&gt;/webvisu.cfg.json&lt;/file&gt; requested ..."information" component="IECVisualization" user="nobody" timestamp="2016-02-26 06:30:57" infoId="0">VisuFctCheckForUnusedClients: Successfully Removed Client at Address: 3063074764, IEC-ID was: 2"information" component="IECVisualization" user="nobody" timestamp="2016-02-26 06:30:57" infoId="0">VisuFctCheckForUnusedClients: Removing Client at Address: 3063074764"debug" component="IECVisualization" user="nobody" timestamp="2016-02-26 06:30:57" infoId="0">Visu_PRG: Address of client with IEC-ID 1 : 3063017864"information" component="IECVisualization" user="nobody" timestamp="2016-02-26 06:30:57" infoId="0">Visu_PRG: Creating Client successful for Extern-ID: 28081 Returned IEC-ID: 1"information" component="IECVisualization" user="nobody" timestamp="2016-02-26 06:30:57" infoId="0">Visu_PRG: Creating Client for Extern-ID: 28081 "information" component="CmpWebServer" user="nobody" timestamp="2016-02-26 06:30:56" infoId="0">State: successful

Hi,are you sure that everything is in current Version?-CODESYS 3.5.8.10-Raspberry Pi plc runtime in 3.5.8.10-in your project compilerversion and visuprofile in 3.5.8.10?I'm sure then this should not happen.If so then please give us a cat /tmp/codesyscontrol.log done by ssh to the pi (by for example putty)BREdwin

Hej.downloaded and installed latest codesys this morning, no change, same problem persisting. In codesys/help/about/version info Iam now running ver 3.5.8.10 on most instances, some still at 3.5.8.0. I opened my old project in new codesys, did a clean all, rebuild, create boot project and download. Made some other testing and fiddling this morning but still no success.Kindly P.

Problem solved. Error was 500mm in front of keyboard (me). I was running a pi B+, not a PI2 as I thought. Pi B+ is now replaced with PI3. Thank you for your patience Edwin.

Excuse me I don't understand! What is the problem?BR
