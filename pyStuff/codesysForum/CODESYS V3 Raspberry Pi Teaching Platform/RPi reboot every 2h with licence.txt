Hello,I have several RPi using Codesys with licence and I could see that my device reboot after 2h.My device has an external watchdog that reboots the RPi if the PLC shut down.With a little bash script I logged the status of codesyscontrol service every second until RPi reboot, and my last entry before the reboot is each time 2h and 5min after codesyscontrol start running.I tried without an external watchdog and the service is exited instead of running, logs below :● codesyscontrol.service - LSB: Prepares and starts codesyscrontol   Loaded: loaded (/etc/init.d/codesyscontrol)   Active: active (running) since Sat 2017-10-28 08:17:06 UTC; 2h 5min ago  Process: 510 ExecStart=/etc/init.d/codesyscontrol start (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS)   CGroup: /system.slice/codesyscontrol.service           ├─650 /usr/bin/codesyscontrol.bin           └─656 /usr/bin/codesyscontrol.bin● codesyscontrol.service - LSB: Prepares and starts codesyscrontol   Loaded: loaded (/etc/init.d/codesyscontrol)   Active: active (exited) since Sat 2017-10-28 08:17:06 UTC; 2h 5min ago  Process: 510 ExecStart=/etc/init.d/codesyscontrol start (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS)I though it was codesyscontrol without licence rebooting every 2h.Is there something special to do at the licence installation? I followed the same steps as this youtube video : /watch?v=eTr9oO9OAy8Screenshot of API Param below :Attachment:Capture.PNGInformation :- Raspberry Pi 3, Model B, 1GB RAM- Raspbian (v4.9.46-v7+)- CODESYS Control for Raspberry Pi SL (V3.5.10.0)- SD are installed by binary copies of another oneBR,Vincent

Hi,-SD are installed by binary copies of another oneIf you copy a licensed CODESYS sd Card,the steps are to activate the "new" license-> remove the content of cmact_license-> restart plc-> activte the new licenseIf you do not follow these steps- you'll have a broken license conatiner from the original Pisure you could activate a license to the new empty Container - but the license from first Pi stay there and will influcensethe license requests in that way.BREdwin

Okay, I tried what you said and that was the issue.Everything works fine now. Big thanks Edwin!Vincent
