When mapping a byte variable and bits variables in coils read registers, updated the byte variable but not bits variables.If i clear the byte variable mapping then the bits variables updated correct.Is there any solution to update together byte and bits mapped variables?Regards

Hi,no only one mapping works,either map the bit's or word.If you map word you could access the bits by myword.0 ...BREdwin
