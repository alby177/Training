I am trying to control a Beckhoff AX5106_0000_0203 servodrive with my raspberry pi 3.The raspberry pi3 image is a preempt_rt image build with yocto.Scanning the Ethecat devices shows my AX5106_0000_0203 and a SM_Drive_EtherCAT_SoE_Standard axis is found.The drive was configured and tested using a Beckhoff CX9020 PLC using Twincat 3. From Twincat 3 the startup parameters were exported as xml and inported to Codesys.When I start my very simple codesys test program, there is an error: EtherCAT is not running, SM_Drive_EtherCAT_SoE_Standard configuration error I also hear a relais clicking in the servo drive every 2~3 seconds. With expert setting enabled, online I can change status init/pre-operational and safe-op.Relais starts clicking when in safe-op. Operational can not be selected.Ethercat daignostic message switches between 'no error' and 'DC Sync0 Cycle Time'.Please advise me how I can control the AX5106_0000_0203 or what I should check (Ethercat parameters, Drive startup paramaters?)
