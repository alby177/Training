HelloI have a Pi 2 B ver. 1.1. I can't read data with my weather station. IP address, port, register is correct. What do I wrong ?

Do you got some progress on this one ? Got same problem. Try to connect to a Midnite Classic charger (Modbus TCP (ascII), and  not able to get any values.  Connection ok, so finding device.Any help appreciated !Attachment:MODBUS_TCP.GIFwhen using Modbus TCP client 7.1 I got values:Attachment:Simply Midbus TCP Client71 com.GIF
