I have a very frustrating problem with Modbus/TCP master on the Raspberry pi. I am connecting to a controller which is a slave and only reading one holding register (command 0x03). The RPI is the Modbus/TCP master, and the controller is the slave. I entered all the paramters correctly, but no matter what I do, the slave is “not running”. The master shows “running”. This is really frustrating. I am able to read the register with a simple windows Modbus program on Windows, so it is not a problem in the master. There is no program in the PI, I just set the Modbus parameters and assign it to a variable.Here are some screenshots.https://imgur.com/92mEhDRhttps://imgur.com/OTDfwmAhttps://imgur.com/X5l3npdhttps://imgur.com/LpD4MIlhttps://imgur.com/znaBrc2https://imgur.com/7ef7cvi

Hi,first:try to do this without device application.(add new Project / Standard Project)Increase the timeout on the slave.For more diagnosis add the slave device to the watch window. (name in the device tree)BREdwin
