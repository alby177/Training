Hi,you need to CODESYS 3.5.9.x -if you are still working with it use current Compiler Version 3.5.9.x and Visuprofile 3.5.9.xBREdwin

HiI use Compiler Version 3.5.9.1 and Visuprofile 3.5.9.1 but the problem exists.Regards

Hi,is it possible to add your project or parts of it to check.BREdwin

hi,this is a bug, the only workaround is to deactivate the property handling for the visualisation.Hope you could work without.BREdwin
