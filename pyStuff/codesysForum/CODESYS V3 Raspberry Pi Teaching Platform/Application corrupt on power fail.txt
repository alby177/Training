Dear Sir,The following are our queries.   1. On powerOFF and power ON of our target device , we find that  in  the Codesys binary messages on startup show ( in the serial console as enclosed)that the application is not found.       We have tried  the following setting in the CODESYSControl.cfg .[CmpApp]#Bootproject.RetainMismatch.Init=1RetainType.Applications=OnPowerfail#Application.FirstLoadInitRetains=1Bootproject.CreateOnDownload=1Bootproject.StoreOnlyOnDownload=1Application.1=PROTO.appApplication.2=PROTO[CmpRetain]#Retain.SRAM.Size=0x1000#Retain.SRAM.Address=0xFA3C57736But  the problem remains.  In our case the binary is available on the SDCard. So on power up we require the boot project to remain available( without being corrupted in the SDCard)2.  Once Codesys  binary finds that   the application is unavailable /Corrupt  , can we trap that error in any QNX application.-praveena
