Hello,I'm trying to add BK1150 ethercat fieldbuds module and some KL-mouldes to Raspberry.When I download the program the Ethercat and BK1150 are marked with orange triangle and I see one error from log :Emergency from device:1001 Error code: 16#A000 Error register: 16#02 Error field: 16#0E 16#04 16#00 16#04Some previous post mentioned that with BK-devices the  user should use "MDP" version of device xml-files but when I asked from support there are no MDP files anymore for newer devices, only COE - files.Are there any experts how can tell how I can set  Codesys to understand COE-definition of BK1150 ?Thanks

Hi,hm a pain ....because this is not needed in Twincat (MDP variant)Use attached MDP and add them manually...  not by scan (this works for sure...)BREdwin

Hello Erwin,thanks for your attachement. But there is only the BK1120 MDP in the zip-file.Do you have another one?Regards,Frank

Ok,now ist works.   I've modified the BK1120 (see the attachment)...Regards,wayne
