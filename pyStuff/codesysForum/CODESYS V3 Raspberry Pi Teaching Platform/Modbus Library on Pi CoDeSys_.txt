Hi ,yes it is no problem on Ethernet there you could append a Modbus TCP-slave or Modbus TCP -Master

Hi, here is a good start point for doing modbus tcp with the raspberry pi and codesyshttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MeQBfQObgkBRplcmax

Hello.I'm finally to the point of having a working Pi with CoDeSys.  However, when I try to add modbus to it, I get several errors on the build.It seems one of the libraries did not load when I installed CoDeSys (I have several pieces of software on my computer that use various versions of CoDeSys).  Any idea where I can get the library referenced in the errors in the attached picture?Thanks,Norm

Hi,this will be solved with next Version meanwhile you could use the device description from that post here:viewtopic.php?f=21&t=5621#p9967Install it to your device repository and 'Update your device in your project' or add a new Project with modbusBR Edwin

Worked!  Thank you very Much.
