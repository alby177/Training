Hi All,I need to communicate from one rpi to several ControlLogix PLCs simultaneously, each ControlLogix having its own ENBT/A Ethernet card. I can find examples of Rpi as an Ethernet/IP master/scanner with various remote I/O devices, but there is no proper example of ControlLogix or ENBT/A setup as a client/slave.I've tried to add in Device repository ENBT/A eds file downloaded from Rockwell's site, but Codesys returns error "Modular Ethernet/IP EDS-files are not supported. Please use the generic device instead". Since I need to send and receive arrays of DINT, it seems reasonable to use MSG instructions with CIP messaging on ControlLogix side. If somebody can point me to documents or links for that I would really appreciate.Thanks.
