Good morning,in my apartment I do not have the ability to pull other cables to match some equipment.The only connection I have between the apartment and the control point where I have raspberry with codesys is the network.My aim is to send the status of a button to codesys and how many times it is pressed to run preset scenarios.For example, press the button once, turn on all the lights, press twice, turn off all the lights, press the button for a long time, cancel the operation.In large lines is what I would like to doSo I was thinking of installing an arduino and passing the states via modbus directly to codesys?Is it possible for you to do this in this way?Have any of you already done something like this?Thank you, Alberto
