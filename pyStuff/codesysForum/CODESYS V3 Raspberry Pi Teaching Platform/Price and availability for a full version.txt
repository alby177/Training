i am not hesitating as all PLC have a processor inside, and the raspberry has a OS that i do know, instead of a black box, and yes i do realize the lack of certificates (i am working on commercial ships so DNV, lloyds, GL is used a lot.(i am now using WAGO (also codesys)

I love minimal systems, as every component can get defective, so when using very low quantity of components the MTBF is better.And another one is price, i use lots of WAGO and not siemens as for the same function the price of the siemens is double .In my field making very small applications price is important.I am getting much lesser EMC from my setup as from a siemens machine, as it uses far less power and as the program is much simpler it works faster about 10 times.Within my raspberry i can get scantimes of 1 microsecond in a normal PLC 1 millisecond is very fast, it means 1000 times ( No need for special fast counter blocks etc.a encoder can be direct connected, with a resolver of 2500/rev i can get a speed of 100 *60 = 6000 rpm and still have every puls, with a precision of 0.04 of a degree.As the processor is so cheap i can make a controller for 100 $. without making special PCB.

Hi Edwin, Do you know for certain what the release date is?

http://store.codesys.com/systeme/codesy ... re=defaultRealy hope this would be last delay.

Hi,not a really reliable statement of the current state:Facts are: we want to release including 3.5SP5 release.-Scheduled date for 3.5SP5 is 17th July-we try to release the Pi runtime 'licenseable' shortly after this 3.5SP5 release.-see attached screenshot how this will work/look like - we are currently testing/validating the licensingHope everything will work till release date then, we know that many of you wait for that full runtime.Thank you for your patience.BREdwin

The licenseable Version is available!http://store.codesys.com/codesys-contro ... pi-sl.html

Great !     Could you please explain us how to apply licence to Rasspbery once we buy it ?  Thank you !

Hi,check the PDF which comes with the store package or read the FAQ's here:viewtopic.php?f=22&t=5641these three points from the FAQ:How to license Raspberry Pi Runtime ?How to to backup your Pi license ?How to to restore your Pi license in case of corrupt SD Card Image ?BR Edwin

Do we need a Dongle for the licensing?

Hi,no a dongle is not needed, just softlicensing.BREdwin
