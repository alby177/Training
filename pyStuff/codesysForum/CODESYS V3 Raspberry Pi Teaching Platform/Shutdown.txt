Will the Codesys runtime environment properly shutdown and save all retain variables when Raspberry PI shuts down by 'shutdown --halt' command?And more general question: does the Codesys on Raspberry PI honor retain variables and where does it save them?

Hi,you need a graceful shutdown of the Linux OS only then the Retain file is saved by the plc runtime.So the only possibility to have reliable retains to use an UPS -Uninterruptible power supply which Triggers then a shutdown of the Linux system.the retains file will be saved to /root/ in case your Applcation is named Application you will find there Application.retBREdwin

Edwin, thank you for assistance. Now I'm working on UPS PIco integration with Codesys. So my Raspberry PI has UPS.
