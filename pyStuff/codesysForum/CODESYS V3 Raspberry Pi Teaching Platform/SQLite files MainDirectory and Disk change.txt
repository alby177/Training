Is there any way to change the main directory and disk of alarm and trend files?I want to write these files at ram disk because if i have an unexpected shutdown of Raspberry the files produce a problem to run again the application after reboot.Regards

Hi,yes, this could be done:[SysFile] FilePath.1=/etc/, 3S.dat FilePath.2=/yourRamDisk/, *.sqlite, *sqlite.metadatathe same with alarm files, you need to specify the path redirection.BREdwin

Hi EdwinI try:[SysFile]FilePath.1=/rts/, 3S.dat, *.app, *.crcFilePath.2=/etc/, *.sqlite, *sqlite.metadatabut when i try to download the application i take error:"Received invalid answer from device"My default configuration that works is:[SysFile]FilePath.1=/rts/, 3S.datFilePath.2=/rts/, *.app, *.crcHelp Please

Hi,i've found the time now to test this and it works for me with the following settings:[SysFile]FilePath.1=/etc/, 3S.datFilePath.2=/home/pi/, *.sqlite, *sqlite.metadata,  *sqlite-journalAttention:Guess before you redirect the path there should not be a bootproject on your pi with have some trend implemented.So the procedure is:Clean Pi (Reset Original)stop the plc bysudo Service codesyscontrol stopRedirect the path by changig the /etc/CODESYSControl.cfgsudo service codesyscontrol startdownload your trendapplication and check in the log if there are Errors and check your new Directory if These sqlite files exist in thenew Directory Environment(redirected)BREdwin

Hi,Need to do one additional remark:If you Redirect to another drive (USB whatever) you need to add *sqlite.tmp[SysFile]FilePath.1=/etc/, 3S.datFilePath.2=/media/xxxx/, *.sqlite, *sqlite.metadata, *sqlite-journal, *sqlite.tmpBREdwin

Please tell us how we can do the same trend files redirection to USB Flash with Codesys RTE 64bit.Regards

Hi,since SP8 you need to do this by the follwing:C:\Program Files\3S CODESYS\CODESYS Control RTE3\CODESYSControl.cfg[SysFile]PlcLogicPrefix=1PlaceholderFilePath.1=d:\yourdir, $trend$BREdwin

We need the same for alarms and recipes ?From SP8 change and for the Raspberry ?Regards

Are you sure?Attachment:TrendPrj.png

Hi,yes i'm pretty  sure please just do it in the config file by using my snippetnot in this configuration menu (tasktray), this leads to a path redirection for all files.This is not what you need in that case.BREw

Hi EdwinWorks OK for trends.Can i do the same with Raspberry?How can i do the same with Alarms and Recipes?Regards

Hi,this is the same:Example for Raspberry Pi[SysFile]FilePath.1=/etc/, 3S.datPlcLogicPrefix=1PlaceholderFilePath.1=/home/pi/trend, $trend$PlaceholderFilePath.2=/home/pi/alarms, $alarms$on recipe you give the location to save them in CODESYS project on the recipemanager, this is differentBREdwin
