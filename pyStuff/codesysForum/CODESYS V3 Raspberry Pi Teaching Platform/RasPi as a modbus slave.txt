I am currently attempting to connect Ignition SCADA OPC server to the Pi as a modbus tcp slave. I can read the registers beautifully, however when I write to a register, it resets itself after about a second.I have tried modbus slave simulators, other devices, and a Wago head unit running CoDeSys 2.3, and they all work correctly.I have tried running with a blank program to verify that the POU wasnt doing something silly.Is there any settings I am missing in 3.5 SP6 that could be resetting the values?Thank you.

Hi,you need to increase or remove the timeout see screenshot.BREdwin

Days of pulling out my hair, over a checkbox.   Thats fixed it.Thank you for your help Edwin.

Hi.I have a wago 8203 as unit for my gate and now i want to use the raspi for the buttons to control it from the house.but I gave up because I don't understand how the thing with the registers works.Does anyone somehow have a (both) project where the raspi simpli gets 4 outputs from variables out of an working wago project and where the raspi sends 4 inputs to the wago project?I just want my hardware buttons be able to be lightet when the gate is not closed.AND!: I don't know why this way with 4 inputs and 4 outputs isn't used anyway as remote-buttons over ethernet.....

Hi,are you using wago 8203 with CODESYS V3 or V2.3?BREdwin

I have a problem with ModbusTCP_Slave_Device on RPi3 - during program execution there is always message "The bus is not running".How can I turn ModbusTCP_Slave on?Runtime version 3.5.10Version of Ethernet and ModbusTCP_Slave_Device 3.5.10.0 too.
