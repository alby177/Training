I need to invert the gpio output pins, how can i do this? I tried to enable the "active_low" feature in /sys/class/gpio/*gpiopin*/active_lowIt works for the value in /sys/class/gpio/*gpiopin*/value but not for the runtime... How does the communication between runtime and gpio works?Is ther maybee a kernal command that works?
