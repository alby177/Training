Hello everyone !I am a new user in codesys and I want to communicate with a stepper motor i've got via serial port, can everyone guide me? The exact things I want to do is to send some commands for example rotate via my com port...THanks in advance 

Look to the SysCom library. You will find functions to set the com settings and open the port.
