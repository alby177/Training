Good morning,Do you know if there is a way to lock a usb port to a specific modbus device?I have two modbus connection rtu and each one has its Modbus_COM where I check the raspberry serial port (usb).Port 1 = ACM0 and Port 2 = ACM1Now when I resume the raspberry happens that the doors are changed with the result that the modbus connections do not work.How do I block the assignment of ports?Thank you, Alberto

Hi Alberto,Google for 'udev rules' this should point you into the right directionBREdwin

I have a solution about it,There is two way to fix one device to one serial port.1) fixed by ID2) fixed by PathOn raspberry side,go /dev/serial/ path, you can se there are 2 folder inside itOne of them is by-idother one is by-path  both of them gives information about your device which connected usb port.I always prefer by-id, recommended to choose by-id. After choosing by-id, go into the by-id folder you can see your device information.Copy this file name ( Copy whole name )You got your device id, and it is time to fix your device id to one port.turn raspberry terminal and write this sentence,sudo ln -s /dev/serial/by-id/THISPATHFORYOURDEVICEID /dev/THISISYOURSYMBOLICLINKNAMEnow, your device fixed to name of you setted.For example,1) I have GPS module which works on USB.when i looked into the /dev/serial/by-id/ folder i can see the name of the my device  ( My device name is  "usb-u-blox_AG_-_www.u-blox.com_u-blox_GNSS_receiver-if00" )2) sudo ln -s /dev/serial/by-id/usb-u-blox_AG_-_www.u-blox.com_u-blox_GNSS_receiver-if00 /dev/XXXbefore these steps, my gps device connected to ttyAMA0after these steps, my gps device connected to XXXso you can use XXX instead of ttyAMA0. And your device always will fixed to XXX.I hope it can help to you

Hello, I had the same problem. I've had a UART onboard chip and a USB-two-Serial adapter. With the help of the CODESYS Support, I've found a solution for this issue.I've done following to fix it: 1.) Use persistent device names - to realize this, check out this blog entry: http://hintshop.ludvig.co.nz/show/persistent-names-usb-serial-devices/2.) Edit the CODESYSControl.cfg file and create a "placeholder" name for the symbolic links (e.g. "ttySS"):Code:[SysCom]Linux.Devicefile=/dev/ttySS3.) Create the symbolic linksCode:sudo ln -s /dev/ttyPersNameX/dev/ttySS0sudo ln -s /dev/ttyPersNameY /dev/ttySS1BR,KevinR
