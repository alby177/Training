Hello,I hope everyone had good holidays and made it well into 2015!I am building a control system here for my little home brewery, using the raspberry pi.In the webvisu I am using two 'Trend' controls to record the temperature profile of themashing and cooking cycle and would like to print them out later on, just for documentationpurposes. Is it possible to delete (clear) the old recorded data which seems to sit on raspberriesfilesystem somewhere? Unfortunately I can not simply limit the recording settings ofthe trend control because different beers might need different durations.Best Regards,Carsten
