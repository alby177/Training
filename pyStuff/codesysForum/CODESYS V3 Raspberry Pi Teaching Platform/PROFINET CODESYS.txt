Hello, I'm traying to connect with a cognex camera with a profinet protocol. Then when I'm going to create a PN_Controler this don't start....How can i do this, HELP!!!!!!!Attachment:foto.jpg

Hi,1. you need to install winpcap (winpcap.org)2. disable the windowsfirewall3. install the slave gsdml... for the cognex camera into the device repository in CODESYS4. Download the project and start it ... rightclick PN controller in the device tree - scan devicesThis scan should show the cam ... give station  name and ip. Add it to the project by this scan dialogNow a new download ist needed...(maybe after you have added some io varable mapping)BR Edwin
