Hello, Does anyone know if Codesys 3 supports Beckhoff EL7031 stepper motor driver slices?I heard that it may be supported in the next Service pack?If no, has anyone managed to work out how to make one work just using the EtherCat mapping?Thanks

Hello,Yes it is supported by Codesys. You just have to add the "xml" device description file provided by Beckhoff on it website.After that, you'll be able to work with the variables of the driver directly into codesys.Cedric

Hi,for using this device with SoftMotion and These MC_Move... FB's a SofMotion drivers is needed.Not really clear if and when it will be released.BREdwin

OK is there another way of moving steppers using just the variables? Sent from my SM-N9005 using Tapatalk
