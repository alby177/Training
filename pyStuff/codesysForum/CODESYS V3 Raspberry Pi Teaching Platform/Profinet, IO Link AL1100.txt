Hi,I am trying t get an ifm AL1100 profinet IO link master connected to my Pi. I knw it can be done as have seen a demo doing just that. Here's where I am struggling. I have loaded the GSDML file in my library, I create my Profinet network. Under the Profinet Controller I go to Topology, press the green arrows to scan for Profinet Devices, I can see my AL1100, I nominate this device, the right hand click, scan and copy all devices to project. I disconnect, ensure that the Port and Peer Station match the Profinet controller, I reconnect but I just cannot get the network to connect to the AL1100, I just have the Red triangle and the connection status is Unknown.   Any ideas where I am going wrong?Thanks

Hi,would recommend to ask IFM (manufaturer of the device) for an woorking example Project.BREdwin

Hi Edwin,They haven't been able to provide this unfortunately. Do you have any example project of integrating any other generic profinet IO Link devices?
