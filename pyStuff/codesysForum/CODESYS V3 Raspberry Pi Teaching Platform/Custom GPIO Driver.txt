I need to write a Custom GPIO driver for an add on board that uses GPIO 18 as a PWM output. I am familiar with writing device drivers, I have looked at the source for the existing GPIO driver library and believe I know what I need to do. However I believe I am blocked by the device descriptor for the Raspberry Pi itself where it has the elements below. As far as I can see this prevents me from adding a custom device descriptor. Is there a work around to allow a custom device descriptor that I can distribute? For development I can add my driver ID to those allowed.      <AllowOnly>        <!--GPIOs; must be set because AllowOnly is global and not limited to this connector-->        <DeviceIdentification deviceType="504" deviceId="0000 0000" />      </AllowOnly>      <AllowOnly>        <!--GPIOs; must be set because AllowOnly is global and not limited to this connector-->        <DeviceIdentification deviceType="504" deviceId="0000 0001" />      </AllowOnly>

Hi David,I have added an JIRA issue for this,sure this should be possible to use your customized GPIO's.At the moment you need to change the original Pi devdesc's for testing purpose.BREdwin
