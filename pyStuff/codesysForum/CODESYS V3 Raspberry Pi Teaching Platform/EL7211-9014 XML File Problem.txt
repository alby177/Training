Dear all,I added EL7211-9014 Servo driver xml file in  codesys using Tool->Device Repository. XML file was added without any error by codesys as seen on picture 2. After this process ı hope that ı can add EL7211-9014 xml file on my codesys program without any problem but when ı right click on Ethercat_Master->Add_Device as seeen in picture 1, xml file didn't  appear. So ı can not add xml file. How can I solve this problem? Thank you for helping.Best Regards.

Dear All, I solved my previous problem. I have one more question. I added EL7211-9014 XML file on my codesys code. But I can not generate SM driver. I think  driver profile of EL7211-9014 is MDP742.  How can I drive EL7211-9014 servo driver which has MDP742 driver profile via soft motion. ?Best Regards.

Hi,guess you need to change the firmware to have the ds402 profile running. Then you could usethe SoftMotion driver which comes with the SoftMotion Package.BREdwin

Hi Edwin,I changed to firmware profile to DS402. I red that ethercat drive will not work with softmotion Generic Driver because of  there is no realtime capabilities on the PI. I generated SoftMotion Light Generic Driver   But ı got an error shown in png_1 and png_2.If ı generate SoftMotion Generic Driver, I do not get any error until pressing the start button.(png_3,png_4).After pressing the start button, I get the error shown  in png_5.According to what ı read, Softmotion Light driver should work without any error. How can ı solve this problem.Best Regards.

Hi, Could you give me some suggestion for my problem?

Hi,I would try to check if this drive is SoftMotion light capable"c:\Program Files\3S CODESYS\CODESYS\Projects\SoftMotion\4.x.x.0\SoftMotionLight\SML_CompatibilityCheck_DS402.project" If this is the case you could go with SoftMotion light,if not - the only way is to use an rt_preemt patched Linux Kernel and use SoftMotion then.BREdwin
