Hello all,I am using the Softmotion Servo example as instructed but I cannot get any more than the 60 to -60 degrees of motion to work. I try to set the servo config to 90 to -90 but it doesn't work. I have verified that these servos can actually move 90 to -90 with python PWM code.Thanks in advance.

Anyone else out there able to get this example to work properly? Is there any other way to use PWM with CodeSys? I really only need to set my server to 2 different positions and don't really need any of the soft motion functionality.

hello,I might suggest to modify SM3_Drive_Servo library.This library use block from library I2C_AdafruitPWM. In declaration area in function block  block 'AXIS_REF_SERVO'  you can find:VAR	pAdafruitPWM: POINTER TO PWM.AdafruitPWM;	usiAxisIndex: USINT;	lrMinPos, lrMaxPos: LREAL;	lrMinPwm: LREAL := 1;        	lrMaxPwm: LREAL := 2;	lrInitPos: LREAL;END_VARTry to change value in lrMinPwm to e.g 0.8  and lrMaxPwm to 2.2 ( you will need to find your own values probably).after this save this lib and install and it should give you (hopefully) wider range.

Please let me know your findings. Thanks
