I left my Pi running for the weekend, when I came back everything was working (input and output LEDs flashing). But when I loaded my browser to view webvisu, it crashed. Webvisu got stuck on the loading page and my I/O LEDs stopped blinking. When I opened CODESYS dev I could log in but could not start the app. I got:error: CmpVisuHandler: ExternId=17487 removed due to timeoutcomponent: CmpVisuHandlerand then:error: watchdog for opmode expired. Address: 1005component: IoDrvEtherCAT (my test rig is running etherCAT)Any idea of what went wrong? It would be really nice to be able to run the Pi for a long time and just check up on it once a while.Another thing I noticed was that my error messages had the wrong date and time, is there a setting for that? Both my Pi and my dev computer have the right time settings.
