Hi all,attached an example how trend recording is working with 3.5SP5.You need for this example CODESYS 3.5SP5 (http://www.codesys.com/download.html)and Raspberry PI Plc runtime version3.5SP5, which we'll release today.Best regardsEdwin

Hallo EdwinI try the chart according to recreate from the example. But get the error Trend1DateRangeSelector, Trend1TimeSelector and Trend1Legend non canter type. Do I miss a Libery? or I have different mistake.

Hallo,then please use the projectarchive.https://dl.codesys.com/public.php?servi ... 8ef674963dBREdwin
