NEWSAfter many tests I've found when the problem is created.If you install the Raspbian OS wheezy 05-05-2015 without updates and CodeSys runtime everything runs ok.After the upgrade ( from internet by using sudo apt-get dist-upgrade ) codesyscontrol shuts down in a few seconds ( look at the picture in the previous post ).Something incompatible with new updates  

Hi,yes at the moment only the standard image works (without doing an update)We have an V3.5.6.10 Runtime for it but is not released.hope this will be done a.s.a.p.I've send you additional an pm.BREdwin

Thank you very much for your support.Best regards.

When is this getting fixed?  The update has to happen to fix other Pi issues, so if running latest Raspbian, your dead in the water.

Hi,scheduled for this week and on the way...BREdwin

Hello,I'm testing CODESYS for RaspberryPi too. I'm using Raspberry Pi 2.Latest kernel (and RaspberryPi firmware) for CODESYS which works is 4.0.9 (https://github.com/Hexxeh/rpi-firmware/commit/46d179597370c5145c7452796acbee0f1ff93392)For update (downgrade) to this version use:Code:rpi-update 46d179597370c5145c7452796acbee0f1ff93392Raspberry Pi firmware list with change notes is available at https://github.com/Hexxeh/rpi-firmware/commits/masterIf you want to use CODESYS with Raspberry Touch LCD 7":Update to 4.0.9Download start*.elf and fixup*.dat from latest firmware and replace these boot partition.I hope, that's help you.
