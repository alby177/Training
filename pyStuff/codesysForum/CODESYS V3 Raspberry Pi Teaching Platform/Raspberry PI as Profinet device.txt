Hello Everybody!I would to use my raspberry pi as a profinet device for the very first time.As I understand right I can configure PN_Device and then add like an input byte as I attached the pictures.Then I can map it from an another raspberry pi or from a Siemens PLC as well.My questions: - There are IP conflict problems as it is shown in the pictures and I don't understand how to configure? - If the configuration is done, how can I create a GSD file to map it as a device?Thank you in advance,Gergo

Hi,if you write you want to use Pi as Profinet deive... this will come up to an official released Version in 3.5SP10 at the end of the year.At the moment you could use Beckhoff EL6631-0010 Profinet device  to realize Pi as Profinet Device.This what you configure in Project is a Profinet Controller.BREdwin

Dear Edwin,Thank You a lot for your quick answer!If I can use the Raspberry as a Beckhoff Profinet device, then it's fine as well.Therefore, I created a project, based on the RaspiProfinet example project uploaded here in the forum.In the attached pictures you can see, that somehow the Beckhoff device is not running.However in the RaspiProfinet project the UR20 device and its input and output have an enable input, the Beckhoff has not. This part of the code is attached as well. Could it be the problem?Any idea where can I look for the solution?Thank You for your help in advance!Gergo

Hi,I thought your Raspberry Pi should be the Profinet Device - which is connected to a Profinet Master.See Screenshot.As I told already - end of the year  (3.5SP10) Profinet-Device without these Gateway Terminals will be available.BREdwin

Dear Edwin,I believe I misunderstand you.I believed that, if I use the Beckhoff definition in CoDeSys, I can find my Raspberry as a Beckhoff profinet device, but I really need to use that device.Then I have to wait until to get SP10.By the way, thank you a lot for your help!BR,Gergo
