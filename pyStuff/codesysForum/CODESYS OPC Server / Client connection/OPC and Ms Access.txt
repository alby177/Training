HiI am new to OPC and need some advice. I got the OPC running and when i check the tags with Matrikon Explorer all seems fine no bad connections . The problem is the next step How do I get the info from OPC to  Ms Access and back. Don't have a lot of knowledge about OPC . Is there a tutorial or guide available .Or if possible can I go direct from Ms access to codesys.Thanks

It is possible in MS Access to add vbscript code. This script can call e.g. a dll or .ocx.There is a freeware OPC client component available on the internet called "opc_da20_components.exe".When you install this you can call it from e.g. an Access Form with the following code:(PS, you can also use the SQL4Automation libraries to connect your PLC to any database supporting ODBC).********************************Option Compare DatabaseOption Explicit'Declare all the variablesDim groups As VariantDim group As VariantDim Items As VariantDim Item1 As VariantDim opcauto As VariantPrivate Sub Form_Load()Me.TimerInterval = 1000'Get OPC Automation ReferenceSet opcauto = CreateObject("OPC.Automation.1")'Connect to the serveropcauto.Connect ("YourOPCServername.xxx")'Plays with groups and itemsSet groups = opcauto.OPCGroupsSet group = groups.Add("Device1.Group")group.IsActive = TrueSet Items = group.OPCItemsSet Item1 = Items.AddItem("Device1.Group1.Tag1", 1)End SubPrivate Sub Form_Timer()'Read Item1 and display in LabelItem1.Read (1)Label0_v.Caption = Item1.valueLabel0_q.Caption = Item1.QualityLabel0_t.Caption = Item1.TimeStampEnd SubPrivate Sub Form_Unload(Cancel As Integer)opcauto.DisconnectEnd Sub

Thank you will give a go
