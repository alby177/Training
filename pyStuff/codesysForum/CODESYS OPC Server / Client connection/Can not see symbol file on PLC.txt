I have a symbol configuration but I can not enable the writing of the symbol file to the PLC. I can not see the symbol file on the PLC after download.Does anybody know how to do that ?RegardsSavas

Which CODESYS version do you use?With V3 the symbol configuration is part of your application and you don't see it as a separate file (maybe not for all devices, but for many this is the case).
