Hello


I made a program with codesys. and made the setting for OPC server. I can connect on the local pc to the server. But on another pc in the network I can't connect to the opc server. I tryed a lot of thing.

I also  tryed a kepware server. That works but that is not an option.

Does somebody knows if it is even possible  to connect to another codesys opc server on another pc? 

already thx,
Rasco

This is probably a DCOM issue.
Run dcomcnfg to check your settings and/or log in to both PC's with the same username and password.
Another thing you can do is turn of your firewalls to see if that is the problem.
