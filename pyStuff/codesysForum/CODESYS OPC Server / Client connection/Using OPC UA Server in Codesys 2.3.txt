Hello, does anyone knows if it is possible to install/use the codesys OPC UA Server with codesys 2.3? My version only have the OPC DA Server and I need to connect it to a OPC UA Client... I tried using the Matrikon OPC UA Wrapper but when I connect to the server, it does not show any of the variables of the server... but if I connect with an OPC DA Client I can read the variables....
