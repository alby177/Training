I have an issue when I try to add a new communication gateway.I append PLC and change the interface to GATEWAY. I then edit the connection, and select new channel.I select the TCP/IP device, but when I press OK, the new channel is not placed under the execisting local tree, but insted added as a new root.I can edit the IP address, change byteorder and save the new configuration, but when I restart the gateway, the configuration has not been saved, so the new connection will not work.I'm connecting to an ABB plc, and using the Codesys OPC version 3.5 SP2 with the V2.3 gateway.All help is much appreciated.Thanks,
