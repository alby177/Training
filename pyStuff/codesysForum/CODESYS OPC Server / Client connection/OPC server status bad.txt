Using CoDeSys version 2.3 I have an issue when using the OPC server. The network consists of 7 plc's but only one of them is used for OPC variables. Consequently I have set up a single-PLC configuration. The communication works fine as long as I am logged in to the "OPC PLC" however closing the CoDeSys application will most of the time make the variables turn to bad in the OPC client. Starting up again and select login to the "OPC PLC" converts the variables to good again.I have also seen that the OPC Configuration changes automatically to another PLC when using CoDeSys to login to that PLC. How can that be possible? I always want the OPC server to work against the same PLC.I have seen this behaviour on two different systems.Best RegardsThomas

We have exactly the same problem using simple polling and the .NET reference library from the OPC foundation. Could you solve it?This is unstable or even not working - we have to keep another OPC client open that "registeres" for each item.Our code is working for many years with a lot of other OPC servers without any issue:Code:string serverURL = "opcda://localhost/CoDeSys.OPC.DA";opcServer = new Opc.Da.Server(new OpcCom.Factory(), new Opc.URL(serverURL));opcServer.Connect();â€¦Opc.Da.ItemValueResult[] resultItemArray = new Opc.Da.ItemValueResult[1];Opc.Da.Item item = new Opc.Da.Item();item.ItemPath = "";item.ItemName = itemName;item.Active = true;item.EnableBuffering = true;item.SamplingRate = 200;resultItemArray = opcServer.Read(new Item[1] { item });

Hi,this will problem be solved with the 3.5.9.40 release of the OPC V3 ServerBREdwin
