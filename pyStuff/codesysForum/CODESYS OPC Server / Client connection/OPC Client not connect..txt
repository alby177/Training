I have properly configured OPC Configurator using same connection CoDeSys (test ok). But application vb and Matrikon only work if is open CoDeSys and PLC is online. My CoDeSysOPC is v2.3This problem sometimes resolves without reason.   sorry my english.thanks

Hi!Have you checked that the windows 'service' opcenum and the rest of the software is started by automatic./Torbj√∂rn

Yes, the service opcenum is successfully started,

The problem persists, help me please?

Is your Codesys OPC and client on the same PC?  Or is the client on a different PC?From my experience with Codesys OPC, I can only get connected when the OPC client and server is on the same PC.  If client and server is on 2 separate PCs, I can not get the client to connect.  I looked through all possible documentations on EnumOPC, DCOM, user privileges, etc...  If anyone has successfully done this, I would like to know how it was done.
