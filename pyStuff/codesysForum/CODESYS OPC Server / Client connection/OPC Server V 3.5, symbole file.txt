Hello,I did create the project in the CoDeSys V3.5 workbench, I did add the Symbol Configuration and login to the target.My problem is the symbol file that I create is not download to the target, also in the target application did not have symbol file.It shown only Application name (only one).Note. My pc has both OPC v2.3 & OPC V3.5 installed.         Also I using the Matikon OPC Explorer to test it. The OPC V2.3 is working fine, But could not succeed on OPC V3.5Any suppestion are very appreciate.Wisut.

It is normal that you don't see a specific symbol file on your device with V3 runtimes. It is part of your application. If you don't see any variables in the Matrikon OPC explorer, I think you haven't configured the OPC server correctly.
