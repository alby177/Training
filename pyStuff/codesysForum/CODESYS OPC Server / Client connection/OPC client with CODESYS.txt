Hi,Is it possible to read data from a OPC server, with a CODESYS V2.3 PLC (Eaton XV panel)?The OPC server uses the OPC XML DA protocol.If that is not possible, what is a good solution to read this data?Regards,Henrie

Hello HenrieIf OPC XML DA is supported or not -I don't know...  Sorry!But from WHERE are you going to read data from the PLC? Is there a management system a level higher?Maybe the easier way is to write date from the PLC to anywhere..., e.g. into a database, file,....Roger

Hello Roger,Thanks for the replay.It is an existing system, were I need to modify some variables by the OPC connection.I can not do anything on the existing system.I was thinking the Eaton XV panel is running on Win CE 5.Is there maybe a OPC client software for Wince5, where codesys the data read from?Regards,Henrie

yes contact codesys they do have this as a separate option.
