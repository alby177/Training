Hello,I am using a 3.5 OPC Configurator to view Codesys 2.3 clients.  I am able to to set up a symbol file and load download it with the program in order to "filter" the variables that the server sees, but I am trying to figure out how to instead not put the symbol file on the PLC and rather put it on the OPC Configurator (as this may better suit my needs).  I am currently copying the .SDB symbol file and pasting it into the CoDeSySOPC folder (where the OPCServer.ini file is) and in my configurator changing the Project Name box to the name of the symbol file.  However, this is not working, and I see all variables being read through the server.  Does anyone know what I am doing wrong?Thanks!
