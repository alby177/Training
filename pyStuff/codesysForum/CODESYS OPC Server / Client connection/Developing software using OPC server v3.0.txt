Hellow, in our company we have been developing software to connect with PLCs for a few years.We have been working with version 2.0 of the dll OPCAutomation, developing programs with VB.NET.This library runs with OPC servers on the same version, 2.0. Nowadays, we need to develop software for OPC Server version 3.0. The problem appears when we try to find an OPCAutomation dll on version 3.0. It seems that it exists but is not available for us, when the old version is available for download on the OPC Foundation's website. We would appreciate if someone could tell us how to develop programs with VB.NET for the latest version of the OPC server (v3.0) since we have no way to get the OPCAutomation 3.0, it's only avaliable for OPC fundation members on web and our supplier recommended us to ask directly to our OPC server software supplier. Thanks in advance, best regards
