HiI have a project to which I enable the writing of the symbol file to the PLC. I can see the symbol file on the PLC after download, so I know its there.If I connect to the PLC from a PC where the symbol file exists in the Gateway Files folder, everything is OK and I can communicate with the PLC as expected.Now, if I connect to the PLC from a "clean PC" (Gateway Files folder is empty), I would expect the codesys Gateway server to see the symbol file on the PLC and copy it to the Gateway Files folder to enable communication. However, this does not happen and the result is that I cannot communicate with the with the PLC. If I manually copy the symbol file using the download tool, and copy it to the gateway files folder, then connect to the PLC communication works. The thing I am missing is the automatic recognition and copy of the symbol file from the PLC to the Gateway Files folder. Can anybody shed any light on this, perhaps I have missed something?ThanksScott
