I'm hoping that someone can help me find the Release history for v2.3 (Something similar to Features & Improvements V3.5 SP9)I have some old Elau processors running v00.16.42 firmware (which I think comes bundled with v2.3.4.5 of the CoDeSys OPC Server).  These are communicating with SCADA systems running v2.3.6.0 of the Gateway on Windows Server 2003.  We frequently have issues with the OPC data transfer freezing, typically for 20 minutes.We may be able to upgrade the firmware, but I want to find out if any such timeout issues have been fixed in subsequent releases. Unfortunately the CoDeSys v2.3 news feed only goes back as far as 2.3.9.32.Where should I be looking for ancient history?  What are the rules for compatibility between versions? What is the latest version of 2.3 which I can run on Windows Server 2003? Many thanks
