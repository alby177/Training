I'm pretty new with CoDeSys.
In our system, we have a data gateway running as an OPC Server on Windows XP Embedded. 
My question is if CoDeSys can Read/Write to my OPC Server as I/O. 
I tried the latest V3.2, in the help of add data source, says "not yet implemented". Your help is appreciated very much.
Thanks

Hello,
hope to have understood correctly (sorry for my poor English): you run an OPC server on your system, used as a data gateway, and additionally you have a CoDeSys PLC. 
If you want your OPC server to have access to CoDeSys, I think this needs an (internal) OPC client, connected to a CoDeSys OPC server to read and write CoDeSys information.
Have success

thanks.
What I really want to have is:
Because I have all data defined in my own OPC Server, which reads and writes to hardware device,
So I expect Codesys be able to browse my OPC Server, get the I/O points for the configuration. In fact it's mentioned in V3.2 help with function as Add Data Resource. But when I try that, it shows "OPC Server, not yet implemented." Any idea when it will be available ?
Thank you.

This topic seems still to be unanswered. I have a similar need. I have a non-CoDeSys PLC with its own OPC server "X". I would like to use CoDeSys OPC Server to aggregate the items in server X. This would simplify my OPC client configuration. So, can I do this with CoDeSys OPC Server?BR,Jukka Peltola

No, this is not possible. Just connect your client to the other server.
