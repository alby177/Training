Running V2.3 in a multi PLC environment [5 Elau PLCs].  Configured using the local Gateway serverOPC data transfer runs efficiently for an extended period until a single PLC is powered down for maintenance purposes.  During this period, the 4 PLCs that are online, properly transfer data.  When the offline PLC is powered up, the OPC server reestablishes a connection, loads the symbols properly, but the tags never go "Active", consequently the tags do not update at our client for this PLC.To correct this issue, we "kill" the Codesys Process ID [in Taskmanager].  Since the Client is still requesting OPC Server data, a new Codesys Process ID is spawned and all the PLCs resume communications successfully.Tried a number of configuration changes to no avail.I would name my first born after the guru who can help me with this one.... this problem is killing our OEE calculations!!

I would start by installing the latest version of the OPC server.Then I would increase the time-out settings in the OPC server configuration.Does this help?My questions:Do you load the symbol file in the PLC, or is this only on the PC?Do you get any error messages in the OPCserver.log?

Thank you TimvH.  Currently in the process of identifying a distributor in the US for the latest Codesys OPC Server [no US distr. listed on the CoDeSys website].

The OPC Version 3 works like a charm.  Handles the sdb files much better.  Log files are more descriptive and robust.When we power down a single PLC [in a Multi PLC environment] and power it back up, the OPC Server reinitiates communications with lost PLC and does not miss a beat.  V3=much better OPC Server.Thanks TimVH; the worlds now a better place.  I will bequeath the name "TIM" to my next pet........................!



tim please close your eyes it is 5 in the morning.
