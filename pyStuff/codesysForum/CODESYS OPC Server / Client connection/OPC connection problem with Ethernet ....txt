We use LMC058 ( Schneider Electric Motion controller) ... Software SoMachine V3.0 / Codesys 3.4 we connect to the plc through USB or Ethernet without problem ... When we try the OPC server with the USB cable that work fine, but when we try with ethernet no connection ! Do you have any idea ? On XP or Windows 7 same behavior !

CoDeSys V3 supports different Ethernet protocols for communication.You probably selected the TCP/IP protocol and set the IP address of the PLC in the connection settings.Maybe this doesn't work with the LMC controller (I am not sure).What you could try is set the name/address of the PLC in the box above this.You can find the name/address when you go to the communication settings in SoMachine.Double click on the device name. You should see the Gateway and below this your PLC. Here you can find which name the device has (you normally cannot specify this yourself).Here you should also see the address (I am not sure with SoMachine). The address is something like 0001.010A or 001C.Use the name or address in the OPC server and try again.
