Dear allI have two questions....1. Can the CODESYS OPC DA Server SL make connection with a CodeSys SoftPLC (Control Win or a Control RTE SL) ?2. In the CODESYS OPC DA Server SL configuration, see picture, according to the manual the "PLC name (recommended) or address" should be set. The manual also refers to this as a node. But how do I find out the name or address of a specific SoftPLC (I run two simultaneously)? Attachment:manual_OPCConfig_081206_as.jpgI have tried with various guesses. And tried to connect to the DA server without success. All runs on the same PC. From the picture I would guess the address is 004 or 0301.A026.Attachment:manual_workspace_081233_as.jpgThank you!
