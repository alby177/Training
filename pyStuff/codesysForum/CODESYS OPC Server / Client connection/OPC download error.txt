Hallo everybody,
I'm trying to use a OPC server with codesys.
when I select in workspace and I configure the symbol table and select all the global variable.

when I download the software updated I have this error:
"The last online service has not benn executed correctly!
Servive number: 48, Error number:80
File 'DOWNLOAD.SDB' could not be written."

If I select a small variable, no problem????

Thanx 4 your help.
