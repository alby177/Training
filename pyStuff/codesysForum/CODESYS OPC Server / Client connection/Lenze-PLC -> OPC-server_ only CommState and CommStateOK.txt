Hi,We have a setup with a Lenze L-force 3200C plc that is connected to OPC-server 3.8 (downloaded from Lenze website but appears to be a CodeSys product)The plc has been loaded with a simple routine with 1 or 2 metrics (as said by the supplier)Connection to plc is OK (ping + webinterface) on interface X2 of the plc. With OPC explorer client (Kepware) only 2 tags are present: CommState and CommStateOK are present.OPC-server and OPC client are both on the same windows 8 embedded pc-system (so DCOM could not be an issue, as far as I know) - note: on windows 7 pc-system we have the same results.Have made some extra settings in the expert mode, but makes no differencesDoes any one has a clue why we can not get see more tags then the two mentioned above. I expect minimal some tags about the plc system itself, besides the tags of the loaded routine that is runningKind regardsAshley Pietersen

First you need to add the "symbol configuration" to the PLC application and select the variables which you would like to access with your OPC client. Then download this application to the PLC.Then open the OPCConfigurator and configure your device correctly (gateway V3 and set the correct communication parameters).Then start your OPC client and try to connect.When it is not successful, check the logger (see C:\ProgramData\CoDeSysOPC\OPCServer.log).CommState and CommStateOK are 2 implicit variables of the OPC server and give you a general indication of the status of the connection. These are not variables which are read from the PLC.
