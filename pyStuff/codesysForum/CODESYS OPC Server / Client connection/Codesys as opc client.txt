Hi,I have just started explore Codesys and I'm wondering.Instead of regular I/O, i would like to use codesys as an OPC client connected to one or more opc servers and use the data from the server(s) directly inside of the codesys project.O

This would be very useful.At the moment we have to use a third party server to server connector to acheive this
