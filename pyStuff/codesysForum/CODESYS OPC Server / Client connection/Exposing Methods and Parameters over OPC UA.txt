Hi,I’m using CODESYS (V3.5 SP9 Patch 3) and UaExpert (V1.4.2.256) and running my application on a Raspberry Pi (CODESYS Control for Raspberry Pi SL, Version 3.5.9.20). Everything connects and works fine, for the most part, however I would like to be able to expose POUs outside of the Main Task and especially function blocks and their methods and properties.Here is an image to give you an example:As you can see, the CODESYS panel shows a function block (Speed) with methods (Decrease/Increase) and a parameter (Value) – but the UAExpert Address Space only gives me the instance’s variables.Here is an example (from a different program running on a web browser – not a Pi) of what I would like to achieve:As you can see, the object’s methods and properties are exposed, and can be worked with inside UaExpert. (Since it’s not shown, and in case it’s important, I should note that the directory path for this object is simply ‘Root > Objects > TT-04’ )So is it possible to expose these POU elements?Regards,Ciaran
