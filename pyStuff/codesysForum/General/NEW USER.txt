CAN ANYONE RECOMEND A BOOK WHICH MIGHT BE AVAILABLE GIVING PROGRAM EXAMPLE AND GUIDE LINES IS THERE A WEBSITE FOR NEW USERS

I could recommend the book from Robert Lewis: "Programming Industrial Control Systems Using IEC 1131-3". I used for CoDeSys training courses. You can find information on the PLCopen website (it is the 6th book in the list):
http://www.plcopen.org/pages/promotion/ ... C%201131-3

There are some more interesting books, but only in German.

If you're going to get that book, don't get it from amazon.co.uk
as crazy as it sounds it's actually half the price from amazon.com (£98 from .co.uk and $66 from .com)
it's £44 from waterstones and 69Eu from PLCOpen. hope this helps you

P.S. be careful as you read through this because I change between GBP, USD and EUR
