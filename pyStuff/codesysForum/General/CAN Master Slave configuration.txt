Hi every1..
I am using CAN master slave configuration in my project. In plc configuration I am not clear about certain things like module id , sync cob id etc...Can someone refer me with some good reading references where I can get to know about CAN Master and slave n its configuratin details..
Any kind of help is praiseworthy.
Cheers,
Rajat Bansal

You might start at http://www.canopen.org

You can download the basic standards for free.

I have found what I believe is a pretty good book in english titled:
"Embedded Networking with CAN dan CANopen" ISBN0-929392-78-7

Also, in the help file there is a large section on CAN configuration that describes each window and what the parameters mean.  At least in 2.3 which is the version I am using.

Regards
