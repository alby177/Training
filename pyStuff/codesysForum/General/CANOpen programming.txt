Good afternoon all,This is my first time programming with CoDeSys, and I am attempting to program an IFM CR0032.  I have played around in CoDeSys and found some great function blocks and managed to figure out how to get PWM outputs, analog inputs, etc.  I am having trouble communicating with a joystick designed to work over the CANOpen protocol.  I have tried to setup a program to first activate the CANx_Master_Status and CANx_MASTER_EMCY_HANDLER, followed by a POU for the CAN communication.  It is activated in the main POU and consists of a CANx_BAUDRATE FB followed by a CANx FB to initiate the CAN network, then a CANx_TRANSMIT to attempt to communicate with the joystick, I have also tried similar setups with the CANx_RECEIVE FB.  I have the EDS file for the joystick and have installed it properly in the PLC configuration.  My main questions are is this the correct way to try and initialize/communicate with the joystick? secondly, how do I setup the parameter manager, I can't seem to figure out how to associate the PDO's in the EDS with the parameter manager. Any help in these matters would be terrific. Thanks all!
