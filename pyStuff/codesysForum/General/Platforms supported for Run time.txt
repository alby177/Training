Hi,
We are looking at buliding a PC104 platform running QNX but its unclear to me how we get the CoDeSys runtime environment working.  

Does S3 Software maintain a list of compatible or certified configurations?  

The website states:
Quote:CoDeSys is a ready product available off-the-shelf and simply needs to be adapted to your hardware. The customization is thus quick and easy to realise: Short time to market. 

I presume this adaptation needs to be done by S3Software - any ballpark on costs?

Thank you
