Hallo everybody,
Using win xp embedded I have space disk problem.

Question is :

Is it possible change the path of extracting files on the installation initial phases ?

Thankyou very much 

if you are talking o the 2.x Version, you can extrakt the files with a normal unzipper. If you have a zip-program installed like 7-zip,... just right-click on the exe and choose the directoy you want the files to be unzipped.
Best Regards

Thank You Very much !!!!!

I didn't know this stuff
