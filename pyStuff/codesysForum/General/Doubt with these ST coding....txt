Both Example has the 'Exit' operator, but it work differently... why...???

I feel a bit strange at the 'Exit' operator in the Example 2..
My understanding, In the example 1 and 2, the m3 For loop shouldn't be working with their condition because of the 'Exit' operator will end the innermost loop but the Example 2 works why?

Anyone could help to explain...???

For the Example 1, 
The IF condition's M200 always True and as a result
M3 got 0 value.(it didn't loop at all).

For The Example 2,
The IF condition's when M1=M3 and as a result 
M3 got 5.

You did 'Single cycle' in the debugger, therefore you saw only the final results – after the last iteration. 

In details:
Inside 1-st iteration   m1 = m3 =  0 – EXIT
…
Inside 6-st iteration m1=5,  m3 = 0 – m3 runs from 0 to 5

Do try to use a breakpoint and you will catch it.

and please do not exit inside a loop as the stack will not be correct.
do the question before the loop or after it.
