I am using Codesys V 2.3. The DT datatype range is from DT#1970-01-01 to DT#2099-12-31. Is ther any alternative way to use the dt more than DT#2099-12-31?

Thanks and Regards

next calendar will be ready in 10 years.
however there is a workaround for this problem.
go back 100 years so start in year 2000 and add 100 years in a the year when putting on screen.
replace the 0 with a one and nobody sees the difference.
