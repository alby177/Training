I have had this happen many times in many CoDeSys versions.

Here are the steps I believe you can use to recreate it.

1. Keep CoDeSys application closed.
2. Open a help file *.chm from a CD. Windows will use it's default reader. I was looking at help files for other PLC manufacturers on a target CD.
3. Remove the CD from the drive.
4. Open CoDeSys and go to the help menu or press F1.
5. You will get the following screen capture but you can not get rid of the message box. You are stuck. Pressing any button will not close the message box.
6. If you put the CD back in you can then move on. Not sure if you can use any CD or the one you used to view the other help files. I used the one I opened before.
