Hi,What is the proper way to create a "compiled library". I need to create a library file which can be used by others, but I do not want to expose the source code!I tried password protection, but i needed to enter password to open the using project, so really what was the point.Any thoughts?

Hi,this only possible with CODESYS V3... you could decide with V3 either use .library then you could debug itor use compiled-library with this source code is not visible.In CODESYS V2.3 this is not possible.BREdwin
