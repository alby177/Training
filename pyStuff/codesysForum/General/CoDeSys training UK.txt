I am an experience CoDeSys programmer using Moeller & MicroInnovation hardware, but i cannot find even basic training in the UK for new employees.
I would like to send colleagues on a structured course with different levels so performance can be monitored.
What is out there???

Some ideas :

or

Hoping to be helpful, best regards
