Dear friendsI am doing an application with CP150 xga tv of WAGO, HMI with PLCThis is my master, I have comunication with 750-881 where I get the status of my sensors and where I control valves and motors. Unfortunately I finished my program when I simulated my program everything is fine. But when I want to download to my CP panel appears me the Error message "Program too large for the controller". I don't know what to do about it , because I already make 3 programs and they presented the same errors...For example for my images pipings, tanks I use  the kind of file wmf.Thank you very much Jorge Roman

Dear Friend, for the people that read my post,Thanks to god and my friend Ing. de la Luz From Wago Mexico, Finally I found the soluction for my program.....   The advise that I can tell you is that you have to use a background bitmat, use the kind of file jpeg. This to lower the size of the program. Well, if you have the same problem, send me a mail.

using jpg is good, when you have repeating things like valves use a visualisation and put one valve in it and reuse the vis.check your libraries as they tend to be big, but you only use a portion of it.use simpler bitmaps or even just a rotating rectangle for the switch and the emergency button is just a red circle. pipings just use rectangles and straight corners.etc.
