Hi,I would like to know if it is possible to compile a program and upload it to the PLC via batch command line?The idea is to be able to switch from different versions automatically.Regards

Bump.

It should be something along the lines ofCode:"C:\Program Files (x86)\3S Software\CoDeSys V2.3\Codesys.exe" /batch /cmd build_and_run.cds file.probuild_and_run.cdsCode:project buildonline loginonline runThe problem is I can't get it to log in silently. The query and replace commands don't seem to help at all, even though I do remember them working a year ago. Anyway, you should probably read these two entries in the help file yourself, if you haven't done it yet:Attachment:commandfile.png

Thank you very much!Regards
