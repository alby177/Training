Hi

We have some problems to save the retain variables on a file on the harddisk(Retain.bin).
We have tried with both the functions "SyssaveRetains" and in the plc browser(save retains).

Does anyone have an excample that shows how this works, and what editor that can read the retain.bin file.

Hello

An example project for the PLCWinNT is enclosed to this entry. As the retain file is binary you should open it with a hex editor to look into.

Yours sincerely
Frank Hailer
