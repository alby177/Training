In the help section it states "Current code-segment exceeds 64K."

The currently generated code is bigger than 64K. Eventually to much initializing code is created.

What exactly is considered initializing code? If I new the definition of what makes up initializing code then I have a better chance at clearing this error.

Can anyone help?

Thanks

Some times I get this error and although I am not really over the limit if I perform a PROJECT-CLEAR ALL and then a REBUILD ALL the error will disappear. Also being able to exclude FB from the build in the BUILD OPTIONS helps with memory size.
