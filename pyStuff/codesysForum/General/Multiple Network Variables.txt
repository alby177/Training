Hi Everybody,
I'm starting in these days with Codesys because I need to establish a UDP communication beetween a Lenze PLC and a not Codesys PLC (B&R).

I tested the Network Variable functionality and I'm able to receive and send all the data defined in the Global Variable UDP file.

I have 2 questions:

Is it possible to access on request on a single data of the network variable without enabling Support parameter Manager?

Is it possible to define more than one Global Network Variables definition with different network properties (e.g. one read only and other write only)
When I try to do it I don't get any compile errors but while running I'm not able to communicate anymore.

Thanks for the Help

I don't know what was the problem,
but starting from a new project, I repeated all the steps and now multiple Network Variables works.
Now I Have a structure read only on COB-ID 1 (Index 1)
and a Write on change structure on COB-ID 2 (Index 2)

I still don't know if is possible to access a single variable without enabling support parameter manager.
