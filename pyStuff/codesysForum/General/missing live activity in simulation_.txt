Hi

I am new here and I have yet another beginners question:

Is it possible to see some live activity in simulation as you change values?

say for example that a insert a AND gate in a FBD and there are two inputs "A" and "B" and then an output "C".
Then I start the softplc and load this application to it.

I then mouse-click my inputs once and a small blue triangle appers next the the input names and the comment box says these inputs a set to TRUE .... then --- why doesn't my output automatically turn to TRUE ?

Thanks

I have been reading the manual for V2.3 and playing with CoDeSys V3.3 ...
regarding my question earlier about playing with values in online mode and seeing some changes occur as you change inputs ->
is it mabe the case that I always have to press "write values / ctrl+F7" to see the affect of my input changes .... ?
or is there any automatic "refreash" option?

hope this question is not too unclear (newbie)

Thanks
Óli

I have learned more how to use CoDeSys and no longer have this problem
