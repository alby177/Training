Hi!I'm trying to create a macro to handle export of the *.SYM_XML file so that i can always keep a fresh copy of this at a central location.As the ABB AC500 solution packs all project files into a .project archive, i cannot have easy access to the symbol files when project is closed.Simple file copy via macro works fine, but when i try to use the variables it does not seem to work as expected. I guess the $COMPILE_DIR$ type variables makes no sense to console commands to OS.I do not want to have a fixed path as its a mess to maintain.I think you can see below what i try to do:MACROMacroName: 'sym_exp'MacroMenu: 'Export sym_xml'MacroCmd: ';***************************************************'MacroCmd: ';*           symbol file export                    *'MacroCmd: ';*            use in post build                    *'MacroCmd: ';*          			                      *'MacroCmd: ';***************************************************'MacroCmd: 'system echo ON'MacroCmd: 'system copy "$COMPILE_DIR$\*.sym_xml" "$PROJECT_DRIVE$\$PROJECT_PATH$\"'MacroCmd: 'system pause'END_MACRO
