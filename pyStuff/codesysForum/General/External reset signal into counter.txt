How to external used reset on counter. I have some counters in SCF stpes, when I not used reset. On the end if is valid condition I wanted to used this myCounter.reset := true;

On this record is ignore.

Hi Paul,

a Function Block must be called to react (A counter is a Function Block) so try it this way:

myCounter(reset:= True);
