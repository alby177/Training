Hello People,I am creating one application  using TwinCAT version 2.11.In which, i am getting string data as output and my problemis that i would like to use this values for controling loop of the process.So, my question is that how can convert data from STRING to REALvalues ?I tried STRING_TO_REAL but it didn't work.I also tried with oscat but i have some problem to use function for conversation of string. Any suggestion and help would be great.Thanks in Advance.

Hello,J works with CoDeSys V2.3.9.28 in simulation mode and this exemple of program is OK :-------------------------------------VAR	Chaine:STRING;	ValR2:REAL;END_VAR-------------------------------------ProgramValR2:=STRING_TO_REAL(Chaine);-------------------------------------So :- Is this really this operation you want to do ?- is there no error in the variables declaration ?- Is it possible to use REAL whis your PLC ? (J don't use Twincat)- Is there a bug in this PLC ?- did you try this in simulation mode ?Hope these few ideas can be helpful 

Hello People,Now, it's working.Thanks for your suggestion.
