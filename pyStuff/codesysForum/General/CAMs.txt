Dear Dengjun,

Your question is unlikely to be answered, since it is very broad, and frankly rude, since it does not show that you tried to gain any knowledge beforehand.

Please read the manual on GEAR_IN(), CAM_IN() and CAM_OUT().
Then look at the softmotion-example in the CoDeSys library.

Then state, if possible, specific questions about what you dont understand.

Regards
  Nicolai Hanssing

Thank you very much for your answer! My question is how to change the relative phase of two simultaneously running axis? Thank you again!

For simple running of axes with a specific phase-offset please look at the function-block MC_PHASING().
