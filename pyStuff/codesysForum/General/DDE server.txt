I am having trouble with the DDE server.  I am trying both of the following in Excel:

=GATEWAYDDESERVER|'project'.pro!'variable'
and
=CODESYS|'project'.pro!'variable'

I get the following errors in Excel:
"Connot run 'GATEWAYD.EXE'.  The program or one of its componenets is damaged or missing."
and
"Connot run 'CODESYS.EXE'.  The program or one of its componenets is damaged or missing."

I am using CoDeSys version 2.3.5.8.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Problem solved.  The settings in the Gateway DDE Server software had to be switched to Motorolla byteorder (hardware specific)
