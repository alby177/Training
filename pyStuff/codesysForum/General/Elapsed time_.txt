Hello,
I am very new to CoDeSys and do not find the CoDeSys-help very helpful, hope that you can help me instead   . 

I want to record the time in my POU in order to determine how often it receives indata. How is this done?

Thanking you in anticipation!!

I guess you need function block timer with input PAUSE. It gives you possibility to measure time intervals sum. See attached example TM FB.
