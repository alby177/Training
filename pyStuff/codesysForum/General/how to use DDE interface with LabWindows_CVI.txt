Hello,
 I want to use  DDE interface to be able to change variable of my PLC with an application of LabWindows/CVI. 
I want to know the exact name  of the DDE Server  (GATEWAYDDESERVER? or  AUTODDE?  or CoDeSysGatewayServer? ...).

thanks

Hello, 

in the onlinehelp you could find the chapter DDE and the name of the server:

Name of the program: GatewayDDEServer

you are right but do you know the way to do that ?
