Howdy,

I used to get this problem A LOT but it hasn't been an issue for a while.  Often when editing a project the GUI gets corrupted and requires the computer to be restarted.  This only happens when running CoDeSys and affects the rest of windows.

I've attached a screen capture.

My machine details are as follows:
Windows XP SP1
Intel P4, 3 GHz
512 MB RAM (shared with graphics adaptor)
On board video (82865G)
Directx 8.1
CoDeSys version 2.3.1.4

Does anyone else experiance this problem ?

Regards,
Michael.

The version you use, is about 2 years old. Since then we fixed a lot of bugs and did a lot of changes that might affect this behavior. I would recommend you to download the current version and try again.

I suspected that could be the case but unfortunately we cannot upgrade due to the backwards compatibility issues I raised in my other post.

Michael.
