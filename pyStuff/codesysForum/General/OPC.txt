Hello,I've just started exploring Codesys so this might be a stupid question.When running a Codesys runtime program on a Windows platform, is it possible to use opc data from an opc server as io for this plc instead of regular io modules?Sampletime and scantime is not critital for me.Ola

No, this is not possible. The runtime has no OPC client functionality.You could however read/write variables with you own OPC client through the OPC server from/to the PLC, but I don't think this is what you want.
