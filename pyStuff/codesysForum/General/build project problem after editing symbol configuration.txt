Hi,if I hit F11 to build project, and there are no changes since the last build, CoDeSys just informs me 'Project is up to date' in the Messages window. Which is normal, no changes - nothing to do.But if I edit the symbol configuration (Project / Options / Symbol configuration / Configure symbol file) , save and build, and then build again - there is no 'Project is up to date' anymore.  I may hit F11 100 times without any changes, and CoDeSys builds the project each time.The only way to stop this is to do Project/Clean All , close IDE, re-open it, do Project/Rebuild All. But after doing this, online change is not possible anymore.Is there any workaround for this?I'm using CoDeSys provided by Festo, v. 2.3.9.19Thanks for any suggestions.
