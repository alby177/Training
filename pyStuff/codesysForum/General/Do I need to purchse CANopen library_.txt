Hello, 
We (I mean the project team) are new users for CoDeSys program.  We use ifm CR0032 controller for the project.  We would like to use CANopen protocol to implement the project.  But it is not final decesion yet.

My question is:
Do we need buy CANopen library to implement CANopen protocol?  Is there a license related? Or we purchse one copy of library, the whold team can use the same copy.  By your experience, should we implement our own high level protocol?

The project is a complicated project.  There are about 20 people on the team for 2-3 years.

Thank you for the help
