Hi Guys,

I am getting this error when trying to create a boot project:

The last online service has not been executed correctly!
Service number: 47, Error number: 80
File 'DEFAULT.PRG' could not be written.

Let me know if anyone can help!

Thanks!
Tariq

Hi Tariq,

What controller are you using?  Do you need to have a memory card present but the card is not there or perhaps write protected?  Those are the main things that come to mind for me.

Hi Norm,

I am using Turck BL67-PG-DP programmable gateway.  The unit has built in memory for boot project storage.  I was suspecting that the memory might be corrupted, but I was not sure.  

Let me know if there any other way to fix this.

Thanks!

Tariq

I know this may sound simple but have you tried a Project-Clean All then a rebuild and a download? Does Turck give you a way to "reset" the PLC like back to a bootloader or something to start from scratch?

empty your plc, the files that are not overwritten are kept in memory of plc, thus filling it up.
got same shit with wago, however after a reset it worked fine again.

I have the same problem. The firmware update does not help. This is my third controller with a mistake in the last month . What to do?
