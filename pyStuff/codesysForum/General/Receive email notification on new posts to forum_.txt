I checked my profile settings and FAQ and there doesn't seem to be a way to receive email notifications in the event that anyone in any forum posts a new message? This way you don't have to look through forums to see if there are new posts. There is only a setting to receive email notifications if your post is responded to. Am I right or wrong?

You are right - seems to be the restriction of the forum software.

There is one possibility: If you login you will have the option to view all the new posted messages after your last visit on the right side of the window below the header commands.

I hope this will help you to get a faster overview of the new posts.
