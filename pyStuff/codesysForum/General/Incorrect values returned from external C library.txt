Hello,I'm following the instructions in the attached document for creating an external C library, but I'm having issues.  I've created a library with only one function - testFunc, which takes one INT and returns an INT.Saving as an external library generates a header (.h) file and a source (.c) file.  After fixing the INT -> int16_t issues, I compile with MSVC / Visual Studio, which generates a .obj file.  I place that file and the .lib in the same directory, and import the .lib into my Codesys project.  I can then call the library function by calling testFunc(), either via ST or CFC.  That all works, and it compiles and uploads to the controller.  But the values I get back are just garbage.  For example, I wrote my function to be:Code:FUNCTION testFunc : INTVAR_INPUT   inVal: INT;END_VARVAREND_VARCode:int16_t testFunc(int16_t inVal){   return inVal * 2;}I send the value 10, and get back the value -24569.  Sending different values doesn't change the return value, but calling it in a different place seems to.Does anyone have any idea why this would happen?EDIT:  I just realized that even if the .obj isn't in the folder, I get the same value.
