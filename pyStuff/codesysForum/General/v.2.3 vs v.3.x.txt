Hi,is there somewhere a simple, one page info - what's new in Codesys v.3 compared to last 2.x ?I can't find whatever version changes info.Thanks.

 V3 is 100% new.  V2 and V3 are like DOS and Windows.

thanks Igor, but I don't think the difference is that huge.BTW you can make a "what's new" list even when comparing DOS to Windows. In it you may mention for example the new feature named 'Start button' which one has to use to stop the system Isn't there really some version changes info?

The first fundamental difference is multi..."controllering"  It's possible to develop programs for several controllers in one project.The second, people can use OOP and CAA library in V3.Next one, functions for STRING in V3 were supported wider then in V2.Next difference V3 has single-line comments! Tremendous relief!!! isn't it? and so on...And finally V2 will die and V3 will come instead. )))

They are night and day.V3 supports DTM/FDT for communication to any devices that supports it.OOP if you want to use it but makes it difficult if you are supporting multi platforms V2.3 and V3. Since no OOP in V2.3.CANopen management greatly improved.Library and device repository. Huge improvement over V23 which was self managed.You can theoretically have multiple versions of libraries in the same project since it now supports namespaces.Huge improvements to trouble shooting networks, force variables etc..A few draw backs:Too Slow when developing in windows (Not PLC cycle time). I feel more productive in V23 than V3.Developer settings should not only be limited to tabs as an indent. Tabs are handled differently on different systems. There should be an option for spaces.Sometimes using the option to automatically indent becomes a hassle. cant just palce a generic box on screen and type in AND/OR. You now have to select from list or drag from list. To slow searching for these items. Give me back my ability to add an empty box and type in the object name.

Sorry you can place an empty box and type what ever you want to reference. That is in accurate.Too many windows want to open when you switch between different objects like selecting a visual automatically opens the visual editor. Opening a POU automatically opens the POU editor. Yhings are always trying to resize to the screen and the message box at the botom pops up all the time. Too much real estate is being taken up and resized especially if on a laptop.
