At this moment i'm logging alarms in a file on the plcbut I want to limit the maximum file sizeto avoid the problem that the plc runs out of disk spaceSo when the file reaches the maximum file size and I want to apend a new text line to the file I want alsoremove the oldest (first text line in the file ), first in first out principleIs this posible ??And can sombody give me a hint kind regardsMerlijn

two ways to do this.make a file and when reaching max size start another file, when this reaches the end start filling file 1 again.another way is by removing last line while copying and adding first line.this means always diskactivity.
