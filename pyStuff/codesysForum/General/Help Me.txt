Hi all..
Im senthil..,
I'm novice to CoDeSys plc, i have just bought plc NEXGEN 2000, i placed the power supply module and processor module, then the power has been given. Then as per the Installation manual i opened the CoDeSys v2.3 ,after that i opened the plc configuration from resources menu, bt i couldnt find the module there.,simply i get the display _not_found and Basic Parameter tab, i didnt find module parameter tab there as per the Installation manual, i dont know where i was wrong. Also it would be greatly appreciated if any help to start with plc and how to work and all.. 

Thanks & Regards,
Senthil

Hi,
is there another setup from the vendor?
Did you select the target ?

Dear Senthil,
You need to install Nexgen2000 target. Please ask target files from your distributor/sales channel for CoDeSys. 

When you create a project, CoDeSys will ask for target. Choose Nexgen2000 from the list. (If you have nexgen2000 target installed on your computer, you will see this PLC in the list).

If you do not see any configuration then in PLC dconfiguration screen (same where you have error), select "Extras" from menu and then "Standard Configuration" (Refer the attached bmp file)

This will reset yyour PLC configuration to default as per target definition, i.e. Nexgen2000.

Also adding that a target not showing can also mean that the config file is not found. Maybe there is a broken link in the target or you moved something. Use the Project-Options-Build-Directory and manually search for the cfg file. The path to the config file should be located under the Configuration file box. Once located use the steps dbh alluded to by using the extras-standard menu to update the configuration.

Nice, did not know you could do that.

Thanks.

Be warned that selecting the standard configuration or changing the configuration will completely erase anything that you have. For instance if you added variable names/Tags to the IO associated with the PLC or you added a CANopen master with nodes attached to the network. Selecting Standard configuration will delete any work that you have done to the PLC configuration. Basically you will be starting over from scratch with the base PLC configuration.

As a note and not thoroughly tested I have exported the PLC configuration which is in XML format. I have edited the XML file and imported the configuration back so as not to loose any of my configuration.  You can also import and export sections of the PLC configuration. Make sure you make a copy of your project before you play around with this.

Yup but in this case, the target was missing, and the Can-master-config was small, so this was easier than creating a new projekt, and importing everything.
