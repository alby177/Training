  I have an error in a programe that has been working for some time! 
The error is "INVALID 16#OF" and "INVALID 16#80" Can not find any reference to this.

Thanks

Those are the memory address in hex I believe. If you look at yor target memory layout you should be able to determine in what area the error occured. If it occrured on a long time running unit == Bad memory
