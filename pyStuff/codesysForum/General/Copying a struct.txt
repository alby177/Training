How to easiest copy the values of one struct to another of the same type? In C/C++ the assignment operator does this job but it seems this is not how it works in ST. Do I need to specify a specific copy function for each struct?

You basically need to perform a byte copy. See this post: https://forum.codesys.com/viewtopic.php?t=7671#p17493
