Hi,

I want to do a connection between excel and an automate 750-841. 
Now, I can do that, but the problem is the next. CoDeSys must be allways open and "on line".
And I don't want CoDeSys open. I want a directory connection between excel and the automate.

Can I do that??

Thank you for your response and excuse me for my level of english.

Hi,

please try the attached example. It is based on the SoftPLC CoDeSys SP RTE but should work in the same way with any other PLC.

I hope this will help you further
