HiI tried the connecting the panel microinnovation XV102 with serial port and the siemens modem TC35i. I downloaded the sample from eaton page but the config file is for wavecom modems and falcom. So I guess the responses of the siemens modem are diferent. On the panel I have the PLC licence, so works visualisation with galileo and the PLC function with Xsoft Codesys 2.3.9 sp2.Has any one tried to send and recieved with modem TC35i modem with panel or eaton(moeller) PLC (XC-CPU1xx or XC_CPU2xx) ? The wago sample of sms is great but the lib are not the same for the panel or plc. ThanksSaso
