Does anybody know how to a ssign pictorials to functions in a user defined library?

It is very easy:

After you have created your user defined library be sure about the names of the functions.

Create a bitmap and save in the *.bmp format with the name of the library function (not the library itself) and save it in the same directory where you reference the library from.

Example: You have a library called MyLib.lib in the directory \libraries with the function MyFunction you can add the graphic MyFunction.bmp by copying it in \libraries.

Now be sure to close and restart CoDeSys again - the picture will appear.

I've already tried this; it's not working.

Please try the attached library, bitmap and project.

It's working, but only if the library is moved in the default directory (...3S Software\CoDeSysV2.3\Library) !

I just tested it myself and copied the library together with the *.bmp file in the root directory. It even worked there.

Please check under Project\Options\Directories. Probably you have to copy the library with the bitmap in one of the three library directories. As soon as there is an entry in the Project section you have to copy the libraries in that directory.
