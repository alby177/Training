Hello,Is there a keyboard shortcut or other command to automatically type out the expected inputs and outputs of a function block in Structured Text? For example, when you declare a function box in Ladder Logic then all the inputs and outputs are listed in the box. Assigning variables to these inputs/outputs is then very easy, you just type next to them.However, in Structured Text, I have to call the function block and then look inside the function block to see the required inputs and outputs, and then return to where I called it and type them out manually. It's a pain!I'm hoping there is a better way that I just haven't discovered yet. Thanks everyone.

Use the input assistant (F2 key on my system).  You can select the Function, Function Block, or Program you want to insert and it will insert with all I/O variables for you.

minimize the number of i/o of a function block by using structures and types.obvious you can use F2 like mike says.another way is to use export to xml and use a editor like npp.if you have to repeat a lot think how to avoid it by making the structure of the program differently.and you can mix languages in most cases.i use ladder for safety.use sequence for state machines.cfc for calculationsst for loops and decisions and for all rest.il for memory things (not often) as i love to keep it open like iec61131.have a look at www.oscat.de for nice examples.

No worries, Shooter. Your tip is also important - imagine a FB with 100 input variables. Unmanageable.
