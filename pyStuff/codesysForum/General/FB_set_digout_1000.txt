Hello,

I've a problem with this Function Block on CoDeSys 2.3.6. 

I'm programming a ESX-Micro controller and I'm using the PWM outputs; I wanted use this function, to set the pwm value, because I didn't want problems about the change of PWM frequency; the problem is that  I see that if use the function block set_digout all is right (I check the pwm value with fb_get_dgout_status) and  if I use set_digout_1000 the return value from status.ptOutput.wOutputValue  is 0 for every wPWMValue (0 to 1000).

Of course "status" is a FB_GET_DIGOUT_STATUS function block.

Can you help me to solve this problem?


Thank you in advance,

Claudio 
sorry for my poor english!
