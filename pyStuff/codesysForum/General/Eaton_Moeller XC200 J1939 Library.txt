Does anyone know if there is a library for J1939 communications for the Eaton/Moeller XC200 controller?  I could have sworn I saw one a few years ago but the web sights and product mix keeps changing with Eaton trying to get all the Moeller items into their fold.  I can't find mention of one anywhere.Thanks,
