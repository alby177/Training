Halo..Is there any way that Master can know when the connection to its slave is broken? how to do this..thank you..mRH

You need to use either the CANopen hearbeat protocol or the nodeguarding protocol (Hearbeat is preferred).  The slave will announce its status via 0x700+NodeID 1 byte, status = 5 means its there and active, other codes based on other conditions...
