I have tried CoDeSys V2.3.9.6 with two IXXAT USB to CAN compact dongles and it appears that CoDeSys will try and connect until it times out then moves to the next dongle until it finds a target or no more CAN hardware is found.

When I try this with a PC104 ISA based IXXAT card and one USB to CAN compact it appears that CoDeSys will only connect to one of them, whichever is defaulted in the control panel under the IXXAT applet. The only way to make CoDeSys use a different board is by changing which hardware is now the default.

How does CoDeSys handle multiple CAN cards on one system? Is there anyone that can confirm or deny my findings?

Is there anyone that can answer gateway questions? Hello out there!!!!!
