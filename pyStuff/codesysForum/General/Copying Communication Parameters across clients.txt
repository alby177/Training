Relatively new to Codesys and Wago.  I am using Codesys 2.3 with Wago PLC's on ethernet, and I have setup all of my devices using my Client in the communication parameters.So how can I copy those to other Clients, so I do not have to retype in all of those IP addresses on each Client?  ...or am I going about this the wrong way?  (it seems that if I wanted to upload, I need the communication parameters and channels configured, so I can pick the correct PLC)Thanks!

Basically, looking for an easy way for driver consistency and updates across PLC clients.  I do this with Rockwell RSLinx, and can copy the files across clients so that drivers to devices are consistent.In doing some tests I watched for changes to files and the registry as I made updates and added new communication channels, and was unable to see anything changed?  Surely it can't just be in memory, as it would be lost on reboot.  I must be overlooking it.   If anyone else has solved this mystery, I would be glad to know!
