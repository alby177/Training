Hello,friends

  This is the first time I come here. my english is not well.
  I have a little question
  In the SM_PLCopen.lib ,there is a function  MC_POWER,its input 
bRegulation and bDrivestart, I don't know what's the difference between them.
  please help!
  thank you very much!

Hello,

bRegulation -> enable the drive
bDrivestart -> release the brake, if there is one

Regards
Edwin
