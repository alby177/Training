1.  I have a question about the functions sysrestoreretains and syssaveretains.  I am using these functions to save the retain data and to restore the retain using a usb port on my PLC.  These functions work on my PLC.  HOWEVER, they do NOT work if the file doesn't already exist at the target location.  This is only a small nuisance.  Does anyone who has used these functions know if this limitation is due to my PLC or CoDeSys 2.3?   2. Related question - Once I save my retain data to my USB, I am not able to do any more reads or writes to the USB unless I remove the USB thumbdrive and re-insert the drive.  Any ideas why this might be? Thank you!

What PLC?

It turns out that the firmware in the PLC was very old.  When this PLC is returned to me, I will try updating the firmware and trying it again.  Thank you for your input!
