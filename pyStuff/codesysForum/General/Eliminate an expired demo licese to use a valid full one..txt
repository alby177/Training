Hello, this is my first post.I'm using CoDeSys V2.3.9.46, installed with ABB's "Automation Builder" V1.1.IÂ´m attaching some images to join the explanation of our problem.We bought a library (PS563 from ABB) with components for data logging and water applications.When the library arrived we added it to the "3S License Manager" and requested a license file from ABB, and meanwhile we used the option "Activate emergency license" on the 3S-LM, and used it in "demonstration mode" for testing.Later the demo license expired and we installed the license file provided by ABB. Seemed to be right.Attachment:I1.pngBut when we added the library to the project and tried to use a module the CoDeSys said that there was no valid license.Attachment:I2.pngLater we deleted the "lm.dat" file and started from zero.Attachment:I3.pngAdded library and license files, 3S-LM accepted them.Attachment:I4.pngWhen we opened the project and added a module from library it said that the license is in demo mode (again).Attachment:I5.pngOpening the 3S-LM we saw that the demo license was back.Attachment:I6.pngAny idea about how to use the right "instance" or License of the library (eliminate the demo)?Thanks in advance...Marco Montemurro.
