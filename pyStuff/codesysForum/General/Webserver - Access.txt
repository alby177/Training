Hi there,

I have a problem with Wago 750-841 and CoDeSys V2.3.

When I try to run WebServer and then visit localhost (127.0.0.1:8080) shows:
- (under Opera) Access Error: Page not found
- (under IE) same just other error message
Well, its HTTP error 400.

The CoDeSys is installed under directory: 
Code:D:\Program Files\Wago Software\CoDeSys V2.3\Webserver:Code:D:\Program Files\Wago Software\CoDeSys V2.3\Visu\The PLC is configured with such parameters:Code:IP: 192.168.1.23Port:  2455Gateway: 1210Transport protocol: tcpI'm running WebServer (demo mode) under cmd.exe, file webserver_conf.xml is renamed to _webserver_conft.xmlCode:D:\Program Files\WAGO Software\CoDeSys V2.3\Visu>webserver 8080 2455 192.168.1.23 D:\Program Files\WAGO Software\CoDeSys V2.3The message from CoDeSys is:Code:Web-Server started on:   Hostname: localhost   IP-Address: 127.0.0.1   Port: 8080   Root directory: D:\Program Files\WAGO Software\CoDeSys V2.3\Connected to PLC:   IP-Address: 192.168.1.23   Port: 2455   Byte order: intel************************************************SysSockConnecte to PLC.But I can't see the Wago visualization that was downloaded to the PLC.I also tried Code:http://127.0.0.1:8080/webvisu.htm
Changing WebServers port doesn't help.

Can you help me? What I'm doing wrong. 
Thanks.

J posted the same problem, in the topic "Visualisation".

My version of CoDeSys is installed on the C disk
There is something wrong in the C:\Program Files\3S Software\CoDeSys V2.3\Visu\ webserver_conf.xml file
--------------------------------------------------
<webserver-configuration>
<webserver-port-nr> 8080 </webserver-port-nr>
<target-port-nr> 1200 </target-port-nr>
<target-ip-address> localhost </target-ip-address>
<use-file-upload-dir> true </use-file-upload-dir>
<file-upload-dir> C:\Programme\CoDeSysV23\ </file-upload-dir> to be replaced by <file-upload-dir> C:\Program files\CoDeSysV23\ </file-upload-dir>
--------------------------------------------------
And its works perfectly !!

I hope this can help you 

Thank you for reply.

I read that topic, but I thought, I just need to change the path for the right one, not for some fictional.

I'll check this solution, next week. 
I'll write you back if it worked.

Hi,
It didn't work in my case.
But I found another solution in some cases.

The PLC has it own IP address so i forwarded ports to it. Unfortunately I haven't find how to do this under Windows XP using only cmd.exe

The program i used was AnalogX PortMapper.

If we have a router, it's even easier.
If any one know how to do it under windows console, please PM me.

Thanks for help.

You shoudn't run webserver on your PC. WAGO 750-841 has own webserver. It's installed and runned in PLC OS context.
1) Connect to your PLC from Web-configuration page. In your case:
Code:http://192.168.1.232) Create webvisu and activate webvisu in target options.3) Install java-machine4) TypeCode:http://192.168.1.23:8080/webvisu.htm in browser. Enjoy!

As well, quote from WAGO manual
Quote: Information for Programming and Web Visualization Further information Detailed Information about the programming and visualization, especial the Web Visualization, please refer to the manuals „WAGO-I/O-PRO CAA (CoDeSys)“. You can find these manuals on the CD-ROM „WAGO-I/O-PRO CAA“
