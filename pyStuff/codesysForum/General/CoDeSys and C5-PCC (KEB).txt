Connection KEB C5-PCC (Programmable Communication Controller) with the CoDeSys via the Ethernet interface produced with the next settings:

Code:Online -> Communication Parameters...Address: 192.168.0.95 (IP of the C5)Port: 1200Block Size: 512Motorola Byteorder: Yes

At the attempt to make connection with C5-controller CoDeSys writes in window "Messages": "0 Error(s), 0 Warning(s)". But at that time gives out the message "Communication Error (#0): Logout Performed". All adjustments are taken from Users Manual of C5-PCC, IP of the unit is also true... Please help us to solve this problem.

If I were you first of all I check connection PC<->PLC with ping. If connection is OK then make sure that CoDeSys runtime system is executed.
