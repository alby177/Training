Hello Developers,

I'm having a communication problem between my (pentium) laptop and an Eckelmann Motion Control (Target powerPC).

In the menu "online/communication parameters"  I should set 
Device: TCP/IP level 2
Address: the MC address
port: 1200
block size 128
Motorola byte order Yes

Unfortunately, "motorola byte order" text box isn't editable and the default value is set on "no"

Any suggestion?

Best regards

Dario

Try to double click on the text box instead of inserting any text. The value should be automatically changed from 'No' to 'Yes'.

Thank you!
I've found in theCodesys Gateway Server manual a way to change that parameter using the windows registry but your way is definitely better

Best regards
