Hello,
How to use a RS232 modul with codesys? I found a FB about this module, but the help doesn't allusion the use.
May I get some example about RS232?

Thanks,
Dokee

It fully depends on which device you have, but in general attached code should give you an idea on how to use the standard serial communication library. Import it in a new project and add the syslibcom library to this project.
You manually have to set the bits to execute the FB's.

Why can't I open this file? I have the same problem, I am trying to do a simple program where the device would open the RS232 port and read it. Of course also displaying somehow what it was read. I am working with Eatons XVS440 panel and trying to use the RS232 port.

this post is 8 years old so check codesys site direct.
