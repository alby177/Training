Is there any possibility to plot X-Y trend (for example X
is position of axis 1 and Y is position of axis 2).
I see only X-t trend in Visu!!!

Best regards

Leonard

so i wrote you a program to do this, experiment with it.werk2.pro is actually a EXP file. containing only the things needed.the trendmaker has all in it, you can export it yourself to your own program.i did not use any fancy like types or global.it is working with 100 lines all starting at 0,0with 250 lines it says error in monitor.

When attempting to open your program I receive the following error message:Quote:Error while reading target informationQuote:Error while loading the PLC configuration!Description file for module 'Module.Root' not found.Change configuration directory?Quote:Cannot find 1 of 3 libraries. Change library directory?Quote:The following libraries could not be loaded (Set path in 'Project"Options"Directories'):SYSLIBCALLBACK.LIB 26.9.08 16:43:52Any advice on how to handle this? Is it because I am using the version of CoDeSys (2.3.9.34) included with my PS501 Control Builder Plus 2.2.0 package for ABB AC500 PLCs?

just start the program and ignore all these alarms, i have not used them, but they are standard in the program.
