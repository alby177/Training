Hello to all. This is my first post on the forum.I am using Xsoft-CoDeSys V2.3.9 SP2 from eaton.The target is  a microinnovation screen (XV-2xx-V2.3.9 SP2)The screen is about 2 years old and had an old project on it I wanted to modify.The original program was wrote with V2.3.3On opening the original code, 3 libraries were not found. I have referenced these in the library directory's.The project compiles ok but on download I get " Unresolved external POUs:xSysComClosexSysComOopen ...etc"listing all the pou's in the syslibcom library.The libraries are the original ones as far as I'm aware,Can anybody help?

change the compile program to your old one 2.3.3Use the libs of 2 years ago.and it says it can not find the pou in the lib (other name or check the lib in the window library using two libs with same functionsetc.

Thanks for the quick reply.Unfortunately I do not have the original V2.3.3 installed on this PC.I tried to install but for some reason corrupted the V2.3.9 setup and so I deleted it and reinstalled V2.3.9The POU's are all in the library when viewed. I tried installing another Comms lib with the same functions but no luck.

with 2.3.9 you can compile to 2.3.3 just set the compiler to a different version.
