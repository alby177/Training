I have one problem for configure the analog input, i have a one current transducer for read the phase current motor, my program is reading the voltage is not reading the current. How configure the analog input for read current?

try %IW0
remember to shift all digitals one word up.
the input is in integer and depending on the type of input so scaling will be needed.
for example they start at 8 for zero as bits 1,2,3 are used for digital.
they stop at 32760 for same
so you need shifting a little
