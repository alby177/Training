Hi

I am new here, I just downloaded V3.3 and I was searching for a user manual, is there a user manual available for this version?
if so, can I download it?
if not, is there an older version of user manual I could use?

one more thing, I just started trying out the ladder editor, but
I am haveing trouble getting the "line"  to connect to the right side?
(from the right coil and of to the vertical right side (end line))

hope these questions make some sence

Thanks
Óli

Hello,
first steps document is installed in the installation folder,
there is no manual, just the onlinehelp available.

Also take a look to the following link:

Hi Boris

Thanks for the reply 

I did notice this first step .pdf but I was looking for something more,
I just found this manual for V2.3  http://www.scribd.com/doc/19350819/Smart-Software-Solutions-User-Manual-for-PLC-Programming-With-CoDeSys-23-2005  ... will give that a try.

Thanks for the link to the example project, I had not seen that and I am going to give that a try now 

regards,
Óli

You mean they still haven't got rid of ladder logic yet?
