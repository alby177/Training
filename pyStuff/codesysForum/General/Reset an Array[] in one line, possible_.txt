Hello,I would like to know if it's possible to "Reset" all the index of an array to a value, with one line?For example:I have a array of 5 real. array[1]= 1.12, array[2]= 2.23, array[3]= 3.45, array[4]= 4.56, etc...In a phase of my sequence, I need to "Reset" completely my array[] to a specific value, for example 0.Is there any commands that allow that or should I use a Loop to "Reset" each index one by one...?eg: array[1..5] := 0; or something like that?Thank you for your help,Regards,Fred

There is no standard way to do this.However, if you don't aim platform independence, and your target platform support SysLibMem library, you might want to try:SysMemSet(ADR(MyArray),0,SIZEOF(MyArray));However, this only works, if you'd like to reset everything to 0, or it's an array of bytes.I'm not sure about the performance difference between this solution and a standard ST for loop...

Hello,Ok, I'm gonna to see if I have SysLibMem library.I want reset all to '0', so it would be perfect.Anyway, I can measure the time for performing the 2 methods and compare it... Finally a "For" Loop is not so big to write.Thank you for your idea,Regards,Fred
