Hi! Long story short, those huge spaces between columns in the monitoring pane make me sick:There is no good reason for it to be like this. It's gotta be changed to simple comma-separated rows. Resizing won't help it: rows containing many will still have huge spaces when longer names and values in other rows are already truncated.

There is a option in to adjust the distance. Extras --> Monitoring Options --> Distance of two Variables?By the way: Have a look to Version 3 with the nice inline monitoring solution!

If you go to top of window you can drag the space needed, and yes you are correct as it should be possible to to ease the layout, with comma with/or without the VAR etc.

However it's basically the same as resizing columns by dragging their borders.Quote:By the way: Have a look to Version 3 with the nice inline monitoring solution!Unfortunately, the hardware we currently use lacks V3 support.
