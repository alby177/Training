Hello to everyone,
I have a 750-819 Wago Plc that' s running standalone.
I' ve just connected it to the Lon net.
How may I read the internal Plc variables from the Lon net ?
I' m using WAGO I/O PRO CAA software tool.
May I create PLC Lon variables ? 

Thanks a lot.

Bye
Claudio

sorry i mist this message.
yes it is possible to use it on a lon.
make marker like %MW0 same like input and output
and then you can see them on a special address.
