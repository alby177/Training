Hi there,I'm using a MODBUS configuration in CODESYS between a WAGO 758-874/000-131 and a WAGO 750-872.The project compiles with no errors but I can't write in the OUTPUTs of my slave (WAGO 750-872). I only can read its inputs.Maybe is there any library missing? Could anybody help me?Thank you very much!

what addresses are you using on the slave, and what is the configurstion.you will need to add an offset for correct addresses.

The problem was that my outputs were configured in PI allocation as 'PLC, PLC' not as 'Modbus TCP/UDP'. But now it works. Anyway thank you for your answer. Have a nice day.
