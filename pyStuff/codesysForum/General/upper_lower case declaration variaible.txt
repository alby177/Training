is it possible in Codesys 2 to define 2 variable as following:VAR1 : bool;var1 : bool;without get error on compiling?

CoDeSys variables are case insensitive- both variables you asked about are the same as far as CoDeSys is concerned. This was a decision to make troubleshooting in the field easier.
