Hi, I've got an AC500 PM581 and Control Builder Plus V2.0.2 but I don't seem to be able to set up a new project with PM581 or PM581-ETH as a template or even add the PM581 as a device. Does anyone know if the PM581 is compatable with Control Builder Plus?CheersDom

Hi Dom,If it's still relevant to you, PM581 cannot be programmed using CBP. You will have to run CoDeSys v2.3 (not from CBP) and select PM581 as target.Hope that helps!
