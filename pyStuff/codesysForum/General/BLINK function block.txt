Hi guys,

I'm wanting to flash a stack light, and it looked like the BLINK function block in util.lib was a perfect fit for that.  Alas, I am getting no blinkage when setting ENABLE to true.  ST code as follows:

Code:VAR   blinker : BLINK;   bEnable AT %IX2.0 : BOOL;   bitstate AT %QX2.0 : BOOL;END_VARVAR RETAIN   bStarted : BOOL;END_VAR   IF bStarted = FALSE THEN      blinker.TIMEHIGH := t#1s;      blinker.TIMELOW := t#1s;      bStarted := TRUE;   END_IF   blinker.ENABLE := bEnable;   bitstate := blinker.out AND bEnable;

The docs for BLINK make it look like a pretty simple FB to implement, so am I missing something totally obvious?

Looks like you aren't actually calling the function block, just initializing it's parameters.

YES

You will have to call the Function block then it will work...

CODE:

BLK(ENABLE:=start , TIMELOW:=t#0.5S , TIMEHIGH:=t#0.5s , OUT=>Status );

Variable:

BLK: BLINK;
start: BOOL;
Status:BOOL;

Thanks a bunch, guys.
