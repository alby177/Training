Hello,

i'm working with a usb-can interface model PEAK  IPEH-002021 41434 , with codesys 2.3.9.10 and a plc 

today the adapter suddenly stopped working and now i can't connect anymore to the can line

i tried to check the communication with the PEAK PCAN-View for USB software but i don't see any message

what can i do now to check if the adapter is working?

i have another can adapter, a RMCAN canview usb, 
anyone knows how to connect to codesys with this adaper?

Thanks in advance
Fabrizio
