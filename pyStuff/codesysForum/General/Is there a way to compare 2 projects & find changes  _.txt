Hi,is there a way to compare 2 .pro files (Codesys v2.3) and find all the differences between them ?

Hi,yes there is, but not as a part of CoDeSys.Make export files of both of entire projects (Project ==> export). This will create plain text files, which can be compared by several tools (e.g. Total Commander, WinMerge ...).

Hi pnn,         Go to project menu and you can find compare in that.You can compare two .pro projects with that.Have a good day

Hi pnn!You can also make a 'Merge' between two projects. It's in the same menu./Torbj√∂rn
