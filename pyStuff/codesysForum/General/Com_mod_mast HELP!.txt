Im am using a PM564-T-ETH PLC and i am trying to communicate to a integra CI3 Power meter via MODBUS RTU RS485. I believe i have correctly wired the RS485 link correctly (including terminating and pull up resistors). I have scoped the RS485 line and their is some sort of communication along the line, well at least when i send a command from the PLC (PLC is Master). But there seams to be no response from the power meter. This is the first time i have tried using this command, and i am programming in CFC, so maybe i am thinking i am not syn-taxing my function block properly.I'm am trying to read a double word value from the meter starting at MODBUS HEX Address 0004 (HI byte first) and each hex address holds 1 word. I believe i have set up the com properties correctly in ABB builder.If any one has successfully used this function before with the ABB AC500 series PLC's, could you please help me!Thank you in AdvanceLevi MartinGo The ALL BLACKS!!!

All Sorted, Don't worry!
