Hi,

I'm also using the OPC server.

Triggered by another thread in this forum, I checked the OPC server log file (didn't know that this existed).

Is there someone who knows what the following errors indicates:

**** ERROR: 
Writing values failed to <PLC1>,  GetWriteVariant failed: Error=6

Thanks.
