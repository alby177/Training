Hi.I have a project where i run CoDeSys via the COM interface to create projects automatically.It works for me mostly, but i have a strange problem.The instance of CoDeSys that loads when i start the application is never unloaded from memory when my application exits, thus i end up with a new CoDeSys instance in the processes area of the PC for every time i run the program.I have examined your example very closely, but its in VB, and does not give any clue to this.My environment:Visual studio 2010C# Languageusing reference : Interop.CoDeSys.dll declaration at the top of my class: CoDeSys.CCoDeSys cs;Inside my "generate" function:cs = new CoDeSys.CCoDeSys();My exit function:        private void exit()        {            System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal.ReleaseComObject(cs);            cs = null;            GC.Collect();            GC.WaitForPendingFinalizers();            System.Windows.Forms.Application.Exit();            //but cs still remain in memory....        }How to properly terminate codesys so that it unloads?Thanks...
