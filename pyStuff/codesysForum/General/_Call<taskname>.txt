Hello,
sometimes I find in the poe-list programs with the name _Call<taskname>, apparently generated by the system.
I can delete them and the system works with my original poes according to my taskconfiguration.
When and why are these modules created?
regards
lothar

You will have this effect after the Codesys-message "unexpected behavior: the objects _call>taskname> and Taskconfiguration share the same ID. They now got new IDs"
Seems to be a bug!
