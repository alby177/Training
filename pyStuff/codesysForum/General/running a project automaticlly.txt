but that will open it in edit mode, right?I want that the project will get to "run" mode automatically

Do you mean on the target PLC? It depends on the PLC and architecture. Some PLC's don't have ram space available so the program is immediately sent to non-volatile  memory and automatically starts after you have started the program with CoDeSys. using Online-> Run or F5.Other PLC's have ram and when you download the application is only temporarily stored in Ram memory that is volatile (lost) if you power cycle the PLC. For these PLC systems you have to perform a few steps:1. Download application.2. Go to menu Online->Create Boot Project (this pushes the application into non-volatile (Saved) memory).3. Press F5 or Online-> Run.

You mean start up Codesys visualisation from your PC?You can do this by making a VBscript and putting it in the "start up" folder.[CODE]-------------------------------StrText = ("Start up program. Loading Codesys version 2 point 3.")set objvoice = CreateObject ("SAPI.SpVoice")objvoice.Volume = 100 objvoice.Rate = 1 objvoice.speak StrTextWscript.Sleep 1000Set objShell = Wscript.CreateObject("Wscript.Shell") objShell.Run "path\to\file"Wscript.Sleep 7000objShell.SendKeys "%{F8}"Wscript.Sleep 1000objShell.SendKeys "{F5}"Wscript.Sleep 1000Set oAutoIt = WScript.CreateObject("AutoItX3.Control")oAutoIt.MouseMove 10, 10Wscript.Quit[END_CODE]------------------------------------------"path\to\file" could be something like C:\program_files\S3\projects\test.proNow put this text in a *.vbs file and you are readyYou need to download "AutoItX3.Control" to move the mouse to the top left corner.My script also talks to you   .
