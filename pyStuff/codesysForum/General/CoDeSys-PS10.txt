Hi there,

I have been using CodeSys 2.3 to download a PLC code to PS10 of Multitron company. The communication is RS232. I have written the code and built it but the download button isnt active. Do I have to initialize the PS10 hardware. 

Also I am not sure if I need additional driver card because there are memory adress assignments in the  CodeSys program and I have no idea what they are for. Is it for to use the PC as a PLC?  

Any help about these topics will be wonderful for me.

Hi,
you need a target file for the Multiron device.
This is like a driver telling CoDeSys all the PS10 specific characteristics like "I have a serial port", "I have x bytes of code meory" etc.

You get the target file from the vendor of the hardware (in your case Multitron). 

I hope this solves your problem.

best regards, 
Manfred Werner
