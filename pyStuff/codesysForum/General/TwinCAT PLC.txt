Hello All,
Any one worked on TwinCAT PLC.
I am trying for serial communication in TwinCAT PLC. 
If any reference for this please post it

On which model? The serial port is an add on card? I have TwinCat experience an might be able to help if I knew more.

Thanks!
Let me explain in brief about What I am trying to do now...

1. I have two Windows machine with Com ports connected using NULL modem cable.
2. In one machine TwinCAT is running, Configured Com port in TwinCAT system manager and implemented Small project in TwinCAT PLC using ComLib library to send Data to Comport through TwinCAT system manager. 
     In another machine using HyperTerminal to display the data I am getting from other machine
3. No actual serial device is connected

Issue:
I am able to get the data sent from hyper terminal to PLC buffers used for receive.
But SendString is not working.

Please help me if you worked on this

Hello,


I'm working at the support team at Beckhoff in France.

Serial communication is quite easy with TwinCAT PLC. But please use the last ComlibV2.lib library. 
You can find it on this link : ftp://ftp.beckhoff.com/Software/TwinCAT ... n/Install/

Documentation is here : http://infosys.beckhoff.com/content/103 ... common.htm

And a simple example here : http://infosys.beckhoff.com/content/103 ... lation.htm

Good luck
