Hi,is it possible to update a Codesys 2.3 project in the PLC without having Codesys installed?I mean I make some changes in the project, compile it on my laptop, then email what Codesys generated (I guess *.ci and/or *.ri file) to someone - can he somehow update the project in the PLC without Codesys ?Thanks

This depends on if the PLC manufacturer has implemented any such feature. For example the ABB AC500 has the possibility to transfer boot project with an SD-card.See the documentation for the PLC that you're using.I haven't been working with V2.3 for some time, but for a V3 PLC it is possible to manually change the project if you have access to the file system (if there is a file system).Best regards,Kristian Berlin
