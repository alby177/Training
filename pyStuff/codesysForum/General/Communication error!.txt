Hi everyone.
When I am trying to login my codesys project without simulaton mode to communicate it with the PLCWin NT .exe on the same PC to check whether this works or not. 
But when I login Gateway.exe Communication error (#0) Logout performed comes. In simulation mode I am not getting any error.
Can someone suggest me what can be the error? And How to correct this.

I doubt that there is some problem in communication parameter settings.

Looking for some reply.
Regards,
Rajat Bansal
