Hello, I need to have delayed output every time input changes from false to true. For now I'm getting this only once. In the codesys help I have found this:"As soon as IN becomes TRUE, the time will begin to be counted in milliseconds in ET until its value is equal to PT. It will then remain constant."How I can reset value of ET so that I could delay my output multiples times, not once?Thanks.

if you put the IN on FALSE the ET will reset. maybe you will need a RISE trigger and that negated to get a FALSE trigger when your input changes.

thx for your answer. indeed when IN falls to 0 ET resets. the timer was in an IF statement where it did not get a chance to reset, because the input was putted in a condition, sorry about that, now it works.
