Shooter, I have managed to solve the issue.Another problem that I faced is that I have 2 separate timers in a program but when 1 activates, the other will activate as well although the IN condition for the 2nd timer is not met.When AC_Route is running & the condition for the AC_ResetTimer is met (AC_MasterReset), both the AC_ResetTimer & AD_ResetTimer will be activated.I have checked for all the variables to be in the correct position & there are not overlapping local & global variables as well.

change the names of the timer now both have same name, do this in your program and in the varlist above.

They do not have the same name.1 is AC_ResetTimer & the other is AD_ResetTimer

the timers are not in the var list declared at all.
