I have a short question. Is it possible to get the instance name of a variable and use it as a string?



In this example I would like to, instead of using a new string to input 'BlockName', use the actual variable name of the block. Is it possible, and if so, how?

CoDeSys I a compiler. Therefore in programming system we see variables and POUs names, but after the compilation there no symbolic names in code – only machine memory addresses.

In this case I’d add extra string (or constant string) variable in the FB . In each instance initialization section assign any reasonable name for it.  Next use the variable as the instance name.
