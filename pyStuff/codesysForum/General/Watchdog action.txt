How do you define what happens when the task watchdog fires? I have a wago 750-8202 plc which I am programming using codesys. I have set up a watchdog for the main task but when I tested it, I expected all plc outputs to switch off but they didnt change. Is there something I need to set to make it do this?Thanks.

Hi,PFC200, 750-8202 could be used with CODESYS V2.3 and CODESYS V3depending on the the answer might be different.Which Version are you using?BREdwin

Hi,I am using Codesys 2.3.ThanksTony

Hi Tony,hard to say, I do not have a V2.3 target to figure this out.So I would recommend to ask Wago support.Sorry for that.In V3 it is configurable by plc Settings, thank you for point us to this issue there seems an open issue on this.BREdwin

excpt_watchdog is used for this.it can be used however it is not a safety function.i have all outputs in ladder with a watchdog contact, so when the watchdog is active all important outputs willbe OFF.
