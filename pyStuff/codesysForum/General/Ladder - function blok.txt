hi, again..i need little information..

for example we did a programme at ladder and with prg_LD

then we wrote a small programme at function blok..how to we connect between prg_LD and FBD_LD   ...

thanks

As far as I can see, at first you should realize completely the meaning of Function Block. Your Function Block must have instance (or several instances) in your PLC_PRG. “First steps with CoDeSys” shows how FB is used.

Thanks Michael but i wanna try to tell what i mean with pictures...





In such case you should use PROGRAMM (not Function Block) for “fonk_at_ladder”. You can call this programm via “box with EN”. Look at image:



spasibo Mikail..thanks
