I always used, without problems, the Codesys 2.3 in my old notebook with Windows 10 Pro. Now, I bought a new notebook with Windows 10 Pro (10.0.15063) and installed the same Codesys 2.3.9.51 from Codesys store and a new, little, but annoyng problem is happening, that is: When I'm editing my program and used the intelisense popup to select a variable, the key 'Enter' even put the variable in the program, but the window of the Codesys lose the focus and I need to press with the mouse on the window or select by 'ALT + TAB' to continue editing the program. As I normally use STL to code, it's very annoyng while it is being typing.I tried some things like install others versions of the Codesys 2.3 and google some similar issue, but didn't find anything. Others softwares are working fine, this problem just happen in Codesys 2.3 software.Someone can give-me a help?
