Hi AllI notice that there are many company able to make use of codesys software for develop PLC program , mainly for I/O control . But for motion control there are only few of them , so i like to know why motion control is so complicated to implement ?Hope some one can share with me.

Hi Allcan some one tell me where should i post this type of question to get a reply ?

My dear friendCodesys do have motion control just check Codesys softmotion and even basic motion control too and infact many use codesys for motion control rather than just IO controlSarath 

look at festo,Lenze and many more with codesys motion.

an option could be to check theses 2 linkshttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5DUYVS-pRQhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHHrduwccMkboth (or better 3) application realized with CODESYS SoftMotion  on an Control RTE plccheers

Hi AllThank you for your reply. Especially the Elvis dances on the machine  very creative , if use in exhibition sure can attract a lot people .Back to my main point , So i am right to said codesys V2 or V3 are for PLC logic and Softmotion is for motion control. So for motion control application need to run both software right ?

What are you considering motion control? PLCopen? FB that controls the startup/stop and motion of a VFD? Synchronized / multiaxis motion?PLCopen created classes / interfaces and functionality but no implementation. implementation is vendor specific. So if you are using say Bosch Rexroth then if they support CoDeSys (They do) they will have PLCopen libraries written for their drives.Almost all motion is manufacturer specific. CoDesys does have virtual axis (V3) that you can use to control motion on other axes but they really don't have motion control. Other vendors integrate their motion control into CoDeSys (V3) that makes it look like 3S did it but they didn't.

Steve,i would not really agree to that'they' have really motion, and this is not a manufaturer supported motion,'they' have cnc functionality and plcopen fb's independent from drive manufacturer.You could use this with diffent drives and what about CNC Editor and CAM Editor?Would say this is really motion.cheers
