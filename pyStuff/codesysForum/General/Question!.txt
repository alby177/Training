Hi Guys,
   After the application code finished, we will give the code to our customers and they are responsible for tuning the system. I  want to know whether the code can be protected and the customers can't see the code, but they can modify some parameters.

  Thanks.

 Andy

One possibility is: Put all Functions in a password protected Library. And keep all Parameters the Customer want to change in the Project.
