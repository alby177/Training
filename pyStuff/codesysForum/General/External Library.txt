Hello,

I have followed  the steps in 'C_IN_32Bit_E.pdf' to make a obj file to link  a lib made in CodeSys. It works very well when the '.c' file doesn´t use a function made in another  '.c' file. 
However when it happens, the lib from codesys needs more than one obj file to link all functions. 
I would like to know if to build a lib in CodeSys with more than one obj file    from visual c is possible. 
If not, has anybory any alternative or clue to make it?

I´m looking forward to know any clue...

Thanks a lot,
Daniel

Hi Daniel

Have you managed to make a C external library work in CoDeSys?

I tried to compile a simple function that does nothing but return a single short. 
I followed the steps in 'C_IN_32Bit_E.pdf' and everything went ok, I copied the .lib and .obj files to the same folder and the project built with no warnings. 
But when I try to test it on a real PLC I get the message during download of the program: Quote:Unresolved External POUs: LIB_FUN1
The PLC runs on a SH4 processor architecture, I think this could be a reason to the problem as I compiled the code on Visual C++ 2008 EE.

Here is my file lib_fun.h

Code:/* Enum definitions *//* The Prototypes */short LIB_FUN1(void);Here is my file lib_fun.cCode:#include "C:\Libs\Test\lib_fun.h"/* The implemenation templates */short LIB_FUN1(void){   return 42;} 

Thanks for any help,

Danilo

Try by placing the .dll file.
