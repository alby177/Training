Dear all, IÂ´m programming an 750-880 WAGO, and I need a function block to generate time periods, can you send me the library for the FB.?

I'm not sure if i'm getting it right, but is'nt this what you looking for?Code:Outputtime := UINT_TO_TIME(milliseconds + (seconds*1000) + (minutes*60*1000)+ (hours*60*60*1000) + (days*24*60*60*1000));/Niclas

Well I would like to download the function block.Niclas123 wrote:I'm not sure if i'm getting it right, but is'nt this what you looking for?Code:Outputtime := UINT_TO_TIME(milliseconds + (seconds*1000) + (minutes*60*1000)+ (hours*60*60*1000) + (days*24*60*60*1000));/Niclas

so you are looking for this particular block i found in the eaton moeller standard lib.another place for this is www.oscat.de with lots of functions also this type (it is english. download the codesys lib the pdf file and the txt file to study.

use OSCAT library..using the CLK_PRG FB you can generate a pulse (one shot) clock based on a defined time base, then you can create your square wave "manually"..this is a sample with T#500ms time baseVAR    PulseGen500ms:CLK_PRG;END_VAR(* Pulse one shot 500ms  *)PulseGen500ms(PT:=t#500ms , Q=>_500ms );(* Clock 500ms  *)IF _500ms THENClock500ms:=NOT Clock500ms;END_IF;
