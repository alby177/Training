I am trying to use the function GEN, but is give me an error, saying that a clash between the util.library and the CoDeSys library of compacx3.


how i can resolve this problema?
i need to put one movement like sine wave in my linear motor?


Help me please, thanks a lot.....

what plc are you using?
if parker then look in manual.
do not use gen for this as it is too complex and too slow.
