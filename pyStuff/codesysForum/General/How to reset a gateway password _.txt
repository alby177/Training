Hi,how is it possible to reset a Codesys 2.3 gateway password ?A machine is controlled by a Codesys PLC and in part by a PC. Codesys 2.3 is installed on the PC. From time to time I connect via TeamViewer to that PC, to download a modified project to the PLC. However a support engineer that recently left the company seems to have set a password for the gateway on the PC, and now a connection to the PLC from that particular PC is no longer possible - because no one knows the password. How to reset the password?As the PLC itself is not protected, it's easy to resolve the problem - just connect from another PC. That's what we do now. However it only sounds easy but is practically very inconvenient because the guys there have to bring a laptop to the machine, I have to inform them in advance, the laptop owner can't use it while I'm online etc. etc.BTW I wonder why is it at all possible to set a gateway password, when a connection to PLC can be established from any other computer around. It just makes no sense.Thanks for any suggestions
