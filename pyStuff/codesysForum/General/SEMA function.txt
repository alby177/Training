Hello, 

i have a question with the CONCAT function. It seems that this function is not thread safe. So, in order to it as well, i want to use the SEMA function. 

I anybody does this. I am looking for an example of using the SEMA function. Is is a valuable way of using CONCAT function in a multiple thread environmement ? 

Think for help
