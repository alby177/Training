Hello,
I've read in "User manual for PLC programming with Codesys V2.3" that it is possible to export projects in order to exchange programs between different IEC programming system; where can I find a reference table (or something similar) explaining  the exchange formats (expecially the ones about the graphical languages LD and FDB)?
Thank you in advance,
A.B.
