Hello Codesys people,We are using this Codesys version for a while to program Eaton products, like the XV-102 touchscreen etc.But when we want to open a project on another PC as where the project is made on, we always have problems with loading the libraries.You can add them manually, but we like to know if there is a way to store the libraries in the project itself, so you can open the project on other PC's no matter what folder they are in, because I think the different path's are the problem.I've seen in the help that you can enter in Project > Options > Directories > Project, Libraries '.\libs\' but in the description it says that Codesys then searches for the libraries in the same folder as where the project is saved, and the library files are never at that location because the projects are on a server.So if there is a way to store the libraries in the project itself, or if there are any other possibilities or tips, that would be very helpful.Thanks in advance!With kind regards,Ricardo
