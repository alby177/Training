First, you'll need a VPN connection. You can have the company's IT department create a VPN for you (which can be difficult depending on the IT department) or buy a device like an eWON or Ei3. We've personally used eWON's and they are a breeze to set up, configure and use. Their technical support is also really helpful.Once you have a connection, the next step depends on the brand HMI you're using. You can use remote connection software (uVNC, GP-Viewer EX for Pro-Face, etc.).
