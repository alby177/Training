Hello,This is my 1st trying to write code in IFM codesys.How to reset a timer, the output is active even if the input is reset.The code run in SFC, When the timer ends (in step 2), you return to the previous step (1).When the transition conditions are met (in step 1), you proceed to step 2 with the timer.Since the output is activated (TRUE), there is no time count and immediately go to the previous step (1). Delay_1 : TON;From online:  Delay_1             .M=TRUE             .StartTime = T#39039m12s17ms       <= What's that?             .IN=FALSE             .PT=T#30s0ms             .Q=TRUE             .ET=T#30s0msThanksShai
