I have develop a library on C++ to control and monitor the PLC(Festo's CPX). I works very good (when it has proper connection).Nevertheless I am experiencing a issue: sometimes the PLC does receive the messages (PC<-PLC), it is totally random, but once it starts working, it never fails while it is energized. The work around is a power cycle, but it is annoying.I have logged the UDP messages and I ca see that the messages are being broadcasted by the PC, but the PLC doesnt receive them. The PC->PLC communication always worksI got the idea from this project:http://plclogger.sourceforge.net/index.php/en/Has anyone experienced any issue like this?Am i missing something?How can I identify if this is HW issue or not? I happens with all the CPXs. Could it be a codesys RTE issue?Thanks for your help/Efrain
