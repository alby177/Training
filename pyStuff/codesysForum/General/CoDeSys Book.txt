I would like to know if anyone is interested in a CoDeSys book published and if 3s / staff / user groups would be supportive of this endeavor?

Your silence was a great answer.

Steve, 

Are you talking about a book you would write?  I'd buy one and/or help out writing.  You may want to test the waters at:
http://www.plctalk.net/qanda/forumdisplay.php?f=2
and
http://forums.mrplc.com/

Those both get much more traffic than this forum and would be a better gage for interest in a book.

According my personal experience: I wrote a popular book about CoDeSys V2.3 in Russia, a technical publishing house 'Solon-Press' published it and sold circulation more then 4000.
See here

The writing took 1.5 year. The book intends for engineers, it is not expansive (about 3 Euro – indeed it is a normal price for technical literature here). I had no sponsors and have no a profit then. However, thanks to the book I made a few perfect friends and obtained many contacts for business. Besides, I enjoy the process itself – collecting information, arranging things, writing etc. It is absorbing! So I dream to find time for writing another one...
IMHO: if you wish it and you like it, then do it – you will have no regrets 

I can assist with translating and publishing it in Russia, if you like it. We are hungry for CoDeSys books here 

Thanks guys. I have to give this a long look. If I decide to move forward I need to make sure that I am up to the challenge. Now of course is the extra variable of throwing V3 into the mix and I haven't spent much time with it. I would prefer it to be an engineers book on CoDeSys / IEC61131 (Too many books on IEC61131) leaning more heavily toward the software development and best practices to use to develop real world applications with CoDeSys. Strange that I did not receive an email stating that some one made a reply to the post

_________________Thanks,Steve Pfeifenroth

well steve as you see even in russian there is a fine book.
With version 3 running i would not write a book, just look at the forums
however an ebook on plc is always welcome.
and yes i am from holland so it must be cheap or free.

Dear Steve,
We the 3S team are looking for a good CoDeSys or IEC with CoDeSys book in English. So it is great to hear that you are planning to write one.
By the way I think sharing knowledge and experiances is not a cheep thing or a thing for free, if it is as time consuming like writing a book. Maybee in Igors view it is different he supports his bussines as a CoDeSys distributor by writing a book and other publications.
And now my offer for free: If you need any assistance, background information, someone who crossreads your book or whatever just send send me an e-mail. I will be glad on supporting you.
Best regards
Ralph

Thank you all for the feedback. I am currently getting into real production experience on V3. I love free stuff as well. Especially couches in Holland! I have been looking into possibly starting a web site which would be the start of the ebook. It can become a community edited / proof read book being shaped by the CoDeSys / IEC61131 community. I want to get a little experience with V3 and then move from there. I find a gap between CoDeSys and the hardware OEM. The OEM focuses on the hardware documentation and a generic how to get a program running "the hello world" of CoDeSys but those will never due. I wanted to focus a little more on the software aspects of building automation software with CoDeSys. I would like to develop , don't laugh, "A PLC language best practices" that focuses on the development of PLC software. Take for instance use Camel case for POU names like SetPermissives. If the POU is being placed in a library precede the POU with the library name followed by an under score, Hoist_SetPermissives. Use pascal case for variable names like partCount or currentTime. Add PRG to the end of programs like Hoist_PRG. Precede global variables with a g like gtotalPartCount. How to include comments etc... You get my drift.

a bad thing about your book is that it's about nothing. I’m very sorry, you know, but it’s true. On the other hand, it costs nothing. I’ve downloaded it free from lib.rus.ec. In general, it looks like a collection of translated help files which were gathered into one file. I and my co-workers didn’t find any helpful information. Maybe the book might be useful for schoolkids but not for engineers. Don’t give up! I wish you to write something really helpful for qualified staff.

Hi, unknown!

You wrote you downloaded a pirated version. It could be a draft, extractions or something... I have a contract with the publishing house. They distribute it. If one day they decide to publish it for free, then it is OK for me. I can discuss only the content, but not a price or distribution policy.    

Concerning the content, you are right. My book is not for qualified staff. It is clear. It aimed at beginners. I tried do not just explain the ways for doing things (there are help system and handbook for it), but explained why it should be done the ways, with simple examples. It assists beginners to start thinking more deep and became qualified faster.  During our every day job we have many questions from beginners. The book saves enough time for me and my colleagues and we are quite happy with it. 

IMHO qualified staff should use many different narrow specialized books and other publications concerning different subjects. I have no idea how to write a book each pro could suppose useful.

So, I definitely will not ‘write something really helpful for qualified staff’  

Igor Petrov wrote:You wrote you downloaded a pirated version. It could be a draft, extractions or something...Yeah. Would you mind if I pasted the link for dowloading a couple of your books here? Before I downloaded it I'd already seen the same book in the bookstore.Quote:Concerning the content, you are right. My book is not for qualified staff. It is clear. It aimed at beginners.There are at least three ways for beginners to learn about PLC programming. The first way is to waste money on the book. The second is by using help files. And the last one is to call to the Prolog's support and speak with moody (I'm very sorry) Igor Petrov. In spite of that fact, most of my collegues who doesn't have enough experience in PLC programming just use CoDeSys help files instead of reading the book - it's much more helpful.Quote:So, I definitely will not ‘write something really helpful for qualified staff’  Well... Good answer. Ok, I don't have any extra question. I'm disappointed. See you the next exhibition or at the conference!

i used the link, and yes i can not read russian at all so no help 
however i do like some docs on programming and yes i still think a few simple examples would be fine.

i think the book is good and is a good travel agent for starters, however this mister unknown needs a book so he can copy his program from it and say he made the program.

shooter wrote:...this mister unknown needs a book so he can copy his program from it and say he made the program.Ha-ha-ha! Quite funny... I don't need an assistance. Infortunately, in Russia none of the PLC programmers do the same projects (for multiaxis control and nuclear industry) as I do, which is why I need to forward all the questions I have to the representative office in Germany.

Igor said the book has been written for engineers... For which engineers? Who haven't graduated the university, or who aren't qualified enough, or who just can't use help files, or who can't open http://www.wikipedia.org/ in the browser? I know for whom this book. It's for complete newbies (and Igor agreed). Of course, the majority of the programmers I know in Russia work just only with simple projects (programming DI/DO/AI/AO, using memory resources etc.). My tasks are very different.

Multi axes and difficult is what i like. And yes some companies do have knowledge on your area.
i know beckhoff is very good in this multi stuff.
and they have a very good office in holland

for even more forum stuff goto plcs.org
and to oscat.
They have good function blocks and if you download the txt file you have good docs on it too.

I wonder how much time he spent for it and what was the reason? I thought such thing could happen with detective or adventure stories only. One published a pirated book, others use it and even distribute the link. Crazy world  unknown wrote:Igor said the book has been written for engineers... For which engineers? One of the most complex known applications with CoDeSys in Russia is a huge distributed system with more than hundred PLCs and extraordinary puzzling mathematics. The application engineers are experts in metallurgy technologies. Originally they had experience with proprietary PLC programming systems. Thanks to the book they adapted to IEC programming and CoDeSys in a week. As minimum they reported it this way. Now I could consider the guys most skilful IEC programmers in Russia. There are many similar reports. Certainly for the programmers with IT university background the integrated help must be enough. It was our idea during writing the help system. So, I do not understand your astonishment. The book is a starter for applications engineers with different background (beginner or newbie in IEC programming), help system is for engineers with PLC programming background.  It is clear. I guessed everybody must understand it. It's amazing you did not.unknown wrote:I don't need an assistance. Infortunately, in Russia none of the PLC programmers do the same projects .. as I do..
It means you are a super skilful person, probably a unique one. It would be foolish if somebody writes a book for a unique person (except a love story  ). More reasonable is to publish a book with large circulation for ordinary people. I think we should have more books for beginners, who really need the assistance. 

  Mr. Uncknown, please, do include something practically useful in your replies here. Otherwise I will consider it ‘trolling’ and ban it. Could you give some links for your own publications interesting for engineers? It would be super if you could describe you applications and publish it in CoDeSys web application area. Ok?

igor i love you, 
will you write me a book now?
just laughing.
mr unknown is not very friendly to you, i am surprised you still even talk to him.

Is there a English version of Igor's book to buy ?

shooter wrote:igor i love you… I heard Holland is rather unrestricted country, but.. we here are more orthodox. So, if you are long legs lady…:D mbruck wrote:Is there a English version of Igor's book to buy ?
There is no English version - no reason for translation. There are many rather similar books in English available.

I’d advise you: R.W. Lewis ‘Programming industrial control systems using IEC 1131-3’ (revised edition) – classic book  + take a look on CoDeSys sample projects.

Igor,

your behavior is very nervous. Be a big man! Just tell us that you haven't written the book. In fact you've copied and pasted some pieces of information. It's clear for all my co-workers. And now it's obvious, that you're trying to make fool of me by inserting stupid smiles into the text and kidding. You can ban me if you want to use some administrative buttons, but it will not change my opinion. Sorry.

No problem if we entertain people here a little. There is no other reason to discuss Russian language book on English forum. So please excuse my sarcasm. Sorry unknown wrote:....gathering information from help-files (as you did) into one file doesn't mean 'writing a book'. It is strange opinion. Really the book is rather old. There were 4 republications during 5 years. The information resources for the book are not a secret. You could take a look on Bibliography.  I had about 50 responses for the book. They were quite positive. Some discovered misprints, some offered improvements. It was constructive. Your response is really strange and I do not know how I could use it. It is a pure criticism. I wonder if you really read the book carefully. unknown wrote:..They're prohibited from being published in web or somethere else.
So, you do not able to write and publish something useful. It is a pity.  

Did you really use CoDeSys in military area? Was it some pirated edition as well? We have a few customers who wish to use it in military, but it is not allowed (legally).
