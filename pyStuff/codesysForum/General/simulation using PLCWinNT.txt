Hello friends. I want to test my sample project  using PLCWinNT.exe.
The target which I am using is "CCP XS 10 inch screen simulated".
Is it possible to test this target using PLCWinNT? 
If it is then how to test and if not which 3S Codesys target  is to be used just for the sake of testing.
Cheers & regards,

Rajat Bansal

Hi,

PlcWinNt is designed for using it on targets with windows operating systems NT, XP and XPEmbeded. If there is any other operating system or no operating system you need a special adapted runtime system.
