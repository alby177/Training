Hi,

Is it possible to edit the *.sym files manually without downloading to the PLC? Will the gateway compile the *.sym file into *.sdb automatically? I want to add some more symbols, but I do not want to download a new project to the PLC everytime.

I am using CoDeSys V2.3.

-AP

As far as I know, it is not possible to do this.

Al.
