Hi All,We have a problem with IFM analog Output module CR2513. We are using this module in one of our project for DANFOSS valve 'PVES' type of valves.I made a sample program to test this CR2513 Analog Outputs along with CR0032 controller. My basic problem is how to force these outputs? IFM manual is saying that -1000% = 0.2 Ub0 = 0.5Ub+1000% = 0.8Ub,But I could able to force directly from 0 to 1000% to the channel "%QW130". I could not able to force -1000% as the outputs are "UINT" (Unsigned Integer)data type. Also i am not sure whether i am doing right or not.What is the raw counts i need to force to achive the voltage levels between 0.2Ub to 0.8 Ub?I could not able to found the rawcoutns of the AI/AO Modules on IFM R360 system manuals.Can any one help? 

If this is double sorry for that.the output of -100 % (same as -1000 permille like in manual ) is 20% of output voltage (so 2 Volts)+100 % is 8 volts.i do not know the raw count as the setting is not in the manual.just try it put a voltmeter on the output and run your setting.you will need to set a lot of settings on the ifm to have correct output.the output is an integer so you will need some conversionall real varminoutput :=7maxoutput:= 65528mininput :=-1000maxinput:=1000a calc is always in real so conversion must be donea:= (maxoutput-minoutput)/(maxinput-mininput)b:= minoutputin:= (???_TO_REAL(input)-mininput)out := (REAL_TO_INT ( a*in + b))example input =0in = 1000in most cases this all is done inside these functionblocks.
