Our machine is set up using persistent-retain variables which are entered into the PLC during start-up.We are very worried about losing them after a hardware or software fault.So we go into 'PLC-Browser' and 'SaveRetain' to a CF-card file.We can then read the file from PLC to PC using 'Read File from PLC', or write it back using 'Write file to PLC' and refresh variables using 'RestoreRetain'.All of this works very well!But it would  be nice to be able to read the values of the file into our machine database.But we do not know how to read the persistent-variable values out of the file.Can anybody help ?
