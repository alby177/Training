As it is so much easier to display the variables from the Wago 750-841 controller using Codesys CAA HMI and computer/LCD instead of the expensive HMI that needs to go through Modbus protocol addressing. 

As such, I have the intention to purchase a HMI license. However, before I do that, can I check if the Codesys CAA HMI able to work in a touch panel PC that is running on XP embedded or Win CE? 

Hope to hear from any experts soon and Thanks you very much in advance.

Hello,

CoDeSys HMI (I assume you're talking about CoDeSys 2.3) works with XP Embedded. I'm quite sure it doesn't work with CE. 

A touch panel pc should also be fine. 

We've used it on a Kontron Microclient running XP Embedded connected to a 750-841.

Thanks for the kind reply. It does help to clear my worries. I could go ahead with the HMI license now.

Best Regards
