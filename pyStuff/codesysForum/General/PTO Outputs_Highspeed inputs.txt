Can anyone help me to create a program for PTO output and reading Encoder Input to the PLC.

yes sure we will help you, what do you mean with PTO (on a tractor i know it is a shaft) but i think you have other meaning for this.For an encoder there are existing modules depending on the type of PLC is being used.(btw) this is a lot easier inside a cheap Arduino)
