I have two devices - a Turck BL20 and a Bosch IndraDrive both running CoDeSys. I'd like to share a few variables (Command and Status Feedback) between the two unit and I've tried network variables (over Ethernet UDP), but I have a question about the configuration:Do I set up two lists, one for the Turck > Bosch transfer and the second for the Bosch > Turck transfer, or can I use a single list as only one device is writing to each variable? Using a single list I only see data transfer in one direction.Also can data be configured to send on change of state, and also periodically at the same time?Regards,PJE[EDIT] Does anyone have a simple program which when loaded on two CoDeSys systems can send a 32 bit variable in each direction. This would help me out immensely.

On 3s FTP server I found this. The site will soon be erased to hurry up if you need more examples.I have not tried or used network variables my self./Torbj√∂rn

Thanks,I've downloaded the file and I'll try it as soon as I get into work.PJE

You can use a list from Turck to Bosch, a list from Bosch to Turck and both.You have to know that Netvariables use a UDP protocol, it is to say a non connexion protocol. When you send variables you don't know if the other PLC received ths variables.But if you use a list in both sens, you can create a kind of response.You can configure a list to be send both by the tree type of action (change of value, periodically and on the state of a variable) 

Hi JAPIB,Thanks for the input. This is what I was trying, but for some reason I was unable to get it to talk. In the past I've implemented my own version of network variables between the Bosch drive and a Linux embedded controller, but was hoping to use the built in functions between the Turck and Bosch systems as they're both running CoDeSys.Regards,PJE
