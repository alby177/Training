What is "Download Tool" as mentioned in 3S Info Mail March 2005? 
How it is to be used?

The CoDeSys Download Tool (or Service Tool) is a small add-on software that allows the user to download the application developed with CoDeSys without opening CoDeSys itself.

You can find more information on that tool under the following link:

Thanks for your reply.
I downloaded the manual.
From where can I download this tool?

The CoDeSys Download Tool / Service Tool is not for free. It can be ordered from 3S with the order number 5126 at a buy out price of EUR 1500.
