Hi!
I am testing the CODESYS Demo and I would like to know how to implement a external library written in C or C++. 
I followed the steps explained in "C_IN_32Bit_E.doc" document... When I load the library (*. lib) generated by Visual Studio 2005, the CODESYS presents the following message: "The selected file 'Test.ib' does not contain a valid binary. ( See path in 'Project''Options''Directiories' " 
What's wrong with the lib? 
Someone could send me an example of a external library project written in C or C++ and compiled with Visual Studio 2005? 

Thank you

Billo

You have renamed the .o (object file) to .lib I assume?
