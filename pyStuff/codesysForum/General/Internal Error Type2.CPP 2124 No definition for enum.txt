The program was built many times and compiled successfully. I made a few revisions and now as the compilers is building the application I get the following error (see screen shot). I have never seen this error nor how to fix it but the program does compile fine with no errors. Does anyone know what this error relates to, so I can attempt to get rid of it? What is also weird about the error is it points to D:\CoDeSys\Release\CoDeSys2.3\... which is my CD/DVD drive? Maybe, possibly I have excluded a library item that is need but how can you find which one if you may have a couple hundred library items?Attachment:CoDeSys fault.JPG

Probably too obvious but did you try a "Clean All?"
