Hello All,

I am being asked the same question more and more and it would be helpful to check I am giving the right answer.

The question is, if I have a windows-based piece of software how do I interface with to the remote Codesys controller over the Ethernet and not use a Fieldbus card / protocol.

My general response is that the use of the Tag file database is the key and so long as there's a OPC server in their VB / VC / C# ... system they can pass the data over the ethernet to our controller. Is that the case? Or should I be mentioning DDE Server or ActiveX stuff?

Thanks for any help!

Hello Captain,
you're just right: OPC is the commonly used method to communicate with PLCs.
As far as I know, DDE is older than OLE (which is the base of OPC). ActiveX? Never heard about a PLC maker, doing the communication this way.
Regards,
Rolf
