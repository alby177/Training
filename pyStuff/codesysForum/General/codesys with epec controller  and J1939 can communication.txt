I have zero experience in can communication.Now I have to do a project on epec controller with J1939,I have set the node ID use canmoon of 4 and 6 for the two controllers.I use a can analyser to check can communication,but I can't see the data on node 6,and the node 6 controller can't receive data.Can anyone help me? Thank you. 

How did you connect them? You need to have two 120ohm terminating resistor between them. I am assuming they are J1939 devices or are they configurable? If they are configurable you need to make sure all the baud rates are at 250kb and 29bit ID's. Same with your can monitor.
