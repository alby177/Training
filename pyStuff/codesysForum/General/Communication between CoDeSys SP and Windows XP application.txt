Hello,

I'm starting some testing with CoDeSys. 
Let me explain my problem: 
I have an application that executes a CANopen Master as a Windows XP process. The 
CANopen Master communicates with a CAN controller on a card (designed by us) through a Windows XP device driver.
My question is: What's the best way to communicate
a Windows application and an application (IEC 61131-3) running on CoDeSys runtime?
In my test, the CANopen Master application has two 
buffers (receive and transmit PDOs) in memory. How do I access the buffers in my windows application (CANopen Master). 
Any suggestions on what I could use to do this?
Dll, Shared Memory, I / O driver, lib, etc.? 
Could you please send me an example about this? 

Any help is appreciated.

Thanks,

Billo
