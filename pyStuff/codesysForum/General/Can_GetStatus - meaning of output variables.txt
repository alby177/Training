Hi @ all members!

I am new in CoDeSys and I am trying to connect a "Beck IPC@CHIP" SPS and an "Beckhoff BK5120" Bus coupler with CANopen.

I wanna check the Bus status in my programm. I ve found the Lib 3S_CanDrv.lib with the FB Can_GetStatus. Does anybody know where or how I can find a description what the output variable Can_GetStatus (DWORD) means?

Thanks a lot!

Jan

Hello,

below are the bit informations of return value,

bit 0 : hwOvrnCntr increasing
bit 1 : busWarnCntr increasing
bit 2 : busOffCntr increasing
bit 3 : rxFifoOvrnCntr increasing
bit 4 : txFailCntr increasing

if any knows about other (5-31) bits please update.

According to the BECK-IPC support: This FB is without function and returns nothing useable.
