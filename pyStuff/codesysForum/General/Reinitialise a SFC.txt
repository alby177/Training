Hi,
Im trying to use the SFCInit flag to restart a SFC, but I cant seem to get the syntax correct. My SFC is called SetSpeed. 
I have tried declaring a global variable SetSpeed.SFCInit and also SetSpeed_SFCInit but only get errors when building.

Any help would be appreciated.
Thanking you in advance.

You have to declare SFCInit : BOOL; inside the SFC POU.

Best regards!
