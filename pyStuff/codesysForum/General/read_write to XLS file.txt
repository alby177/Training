I am working on a little project where Codysys is running on a notebook for now, the notebook needs to be connected to a Wago 750-881 controller later on.Now I managed to write an value (UDINT) to a database.xls file in the same directory as the *.pro file. Now I would like to read a value (UDINT,STRING) and so on into codesys.Actually the ideal situation would be that I would like to plug a USB stick into the notebook and read/write the *.xls file from there, but than I have to put in somewhere a path to the file from codesys and I can find that option.Can someone put me in the right direction?

G/DayI have the same problem. Can somebody help?Thanks a lot

or use the library with file from the wago websiteor use oscat.de library.
