Please explain more.Can we use a standard Ethernet adapter without real-time functionality or we need a special adapter?How can we take the interrupt event in task and how can we know from where is the interrupt event?Can you give us a tutorial or an example?We discuss in our company if we can use this configuration ("Codesys RTE + Siemens profinet remote I/o")for future projects but we need this information before continue.Regards.

look on youtube for wago from kurt braun, he has made some nice tubies.

Thanks!      BTW, I've tested the Raspberry Pi ProfiNet Master with a WAGO 750-377 coupler and it works great.  I can post a YouTube video if anyone is interested.-Kurt
