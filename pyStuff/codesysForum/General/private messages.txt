Even if you can order regarding this fields, I couldn't see anything until I pressed the member name, and only the message systems appeared there.In the profile part you can add your e-mail and chat programs you use, like YIM (Yahoo), AIM (AOL), ICQ, etc.I didn't find anything inside this profile that let me access a specific user in a private way using the forum tools. I don't think is intended to save all that data...Anyway, the right persons to ask this is the forum developers.Resuming:- If the question was intended to send private messages using the forum, the answer is NO (except the developers have something else to answer)- if the question was intended to send private messages, the answer is YES
