Hello, I'm using an old version: CoDeSys 2.3.3.6, but unfortunately at the moment I can't upgrade it.
What's happened is that I've renamed the pointer to the variable network file in my project, and then everything is corrupted.
I'm not sure of what's happened, but i'd like to know if anybody knows if it's a old bug.
If this bug is traced i can understand what to NOT do, to not lose again my project.

Thank You.

working with pointers will stay very dangerous as you are working in the hardware addresses. so if you change one thing it will not work anymore on others even 1 letter could be enough.
i always save it to a stick and then into the safe.

maybe i've bad explained what i did.
What i've changed is the network's variable declaration filename or its description into the project.
