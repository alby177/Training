Hello all ,

I am using CodeSYS V2.3 with WAGO Ethenet controller 750-841 & I have a problem that I have three WAGO Ethernet controllers 750-841 , and I need to connect them in a network using switch , but I don’t know how to add more than one controller in K-BUS tree in PLC configuration menu ,how to give IP addresses for each PLC , how to write a ladder program for each PLC , and how to make visualization for each PLC components . Knowing that I programmed , visualized and operated one controller alone ( not PLCs network ).

Hope to find a solution for this topic as soon as possible.

Best regards..

Hi,

1.
for setting the IP-Adress you can use the BootP-Server or the ethernet setting tool from WAGO.
DL from here.

2.
you never see all Controllers in the KBus tree, only the actually programmed.

3.
all programs & visu's are controller-local, but you can exchange variables between the controllers using network-variables
