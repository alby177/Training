Hi,Is there any library for USB in codesys to use for data transfer instead of rs485 comm port.all comm ports in my controller are used.Iam left with 2 USB ports,which am planning to use.Help needed. 

Hi,I did not get how to use USB.But am using an Ethernet to serial converter to use for my application.

USB can be used to flash the source code program or firmware like OS, But there is no way to configure the USB inside the codesys.can i know which brand of PLC you are using??then i will let you know completely

Hi         May be I should say USB port and of course USB is flash device.What I require is USB port programming.  Thanks
