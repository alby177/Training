Hi. I'm new in CoDeSys. And I wonder if someone could help me to process data from a device via ethernet. ie I have a sensor that is capable of transmitting data to RS232 or/and Ethernet way. I connect it by ethernet but, really I have no idea how to do it, is something new for me, because I've always worked with rs232 serial transmission, but the distance between devices is large and there helps me to better use tcp / ip. Thanks for your help. I'm work with a PLC MFD4, and the device is a TVS100. http://www.sick-automation.ru/images/File/pdf/DIV05/TVS100_manual.pdfftp://ftp.moeller.net/DOCUMENTATION/AWB_MANUALS/MN04802002Z_EN.pdfhttp://datasheet.moeller.net/datasheet.php?model=109428&locale=en_GB
