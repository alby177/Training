Hi All ,

I have a porblem with WAGO Web Based Management .

While I was doing configuration on WBM screen , I entered to Security tab on the left side of the screen and entered " admin" as a username and "wago" as a passward  and changed it from user to admin , after this action I logged out from WBM screen .

After five minutes I am tried to enter WBM screen but the explorer respondes with " Web page cannot be found" ," HTTP 404 Not found", although I reset the controller to the default factory settings and formatted it many times from " WAGO Ethernet settings program ", but the same result appears again.

How can I solve this problem ,

Thanks........
