Hi..

Does Codesys have similiar command which name is MOVE command like at OMRON?

Here is an extract of the manual:

MOVE
CoDeSys IEC operator: Assignment of a variable to another variable of an appropriate type. As MOVE is available as a box in the graphic editors LD, CFC, there the (unlocking) EN/EN0 functionality can also be applied on a variable assignment. In the FBD editor this is not possible however.

so just read the manual

actually i asked question wrongly..im sorry..

i had mean a command which name is movelink...at omron for example when u write code like this  ..

movelink ( 1200,10,20)  then 
go 
.....


at here u can adjust servo motor's position with encoder with movelink command...

so i had mean that does codesys has any library file which is very useful for adjusting servo motor's position..
We use Schneider's products.. Lexium05 , LMC20 card... 

im very new at codesys...pls forgive me friends..

thanks

For the LMC20, use the PLCopen commands which are built in.

You need to add the SM_PLCopen library to your project.  From there there are plenty of built in functions similar to what you are asking.

The functions start with "MC" for motion control.

For example, there are functions such as:

MCHome
MCHalt
MCMoveRelative
MCMoveAbsolute
MCMoveVeloctiy

etc...

I hope this helps
