Newbie at work here,I tried to program the following with one single input and one output.One push button (puls) Press one time = output highPress another time = outoput lowPress another time = output highetc.I thought it would be easy. But when I turn on the simulation mode in CoDeSysmy ladder program won't work. Strange becaus i'm not the only one with this problemon the internet. I tried some of the sugestions on the net. no succes.Maybe it has something to do with the simulationmode?I hope someone has the sollution for this.kind regards Yorick

Why don't you post what you tried so we know what language you are using and what you have tried.This should definitely work in simulation mode.

make a pulse of your in signal, now it does switch many times.and yes i will keep the secret as you will have to learn not me.hihi.if you come back with your prog we will give solution

This is what I found and tried.

another hint:the contacts setting are asked not in the beginning, but on every start of a line.i like this type of very simple assignments.and yes good thing you are asking, it will give you a point extra on your portfolio.make this in one line, not more.

and this is solution:(* @NESTEDCOMMENTS := 'Yes' *)(* @PATH := '\/Logic\/FF edge triggered' *)(* @SYMFILEFLAGS := '2048' *)FUNCTION_BLOCK TOGGLEVAR_INPUT	CLK : BOOL;	rst : BOOL;END_VARVAR_OUTPUT	Q : BOOL;END_VARVAR	edge : BOOL;END_VAR(*version 1.1	30. oct. 2008programmer 	hugotested by	oscattoggle flip flop the output changes state with every rising edge of clk.*)(* @END_DECLARATION := '0' *)below the code needed.put it in a function block.IF rst THEN	q := 0;ELSIF clk AND NOT edge THEN	Q := NOT Q;END_IF;edge := clk;(* revision historyhm	13.9.2007		rev 1.0	original versionhm	30. oct. 2008	rev 1.1	deleted unnecessary init*)END_FUNCTION_BLOCK

here you go with a good solution.taken from oscat.look for toggle in www.oscat.dethat is best place to learn.take the file as you can read and also take the txt file.it is all in structured text so you can read it clearly and take parts out of it.
