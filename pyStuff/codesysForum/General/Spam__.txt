It took me while to finally get an email setup that this website would allow for membership, then my first login, I see 3 pages of spam!! Why is this forum such a target?

As the administrator I apologize that all our anti spam efforts where still not enough in order to prevent spammer abusing the CoDeSys forum.Nevertheless we have finally deleted (at least most of) them, including a ban thus the cannot register once again with the same email address. But of course they can try with other email and IP addresses, thus there is unfortunately no real guarantee.In any case be sure that we do all our very best to prevent such attacks - this time it was in fact really bad luck.Thus I hope that after this negative experience you have a benefit of the CoDeSys forum for your work.
