I'd like to make it so I have the option of changing how the date is displayed on the visualisation from long to short date. I could go for the option of hiding the different displays and unhiding them when a variable changes however I could make a lot more variation with the dates if I could work out how to pull in the time from the processer and turn it into a TOD variable. I've had a look at the help menu and it says to make a TOD variable you write:

TIME_OF_DAY#15:36:30.123

This means the time must be defined by the user however I want the time to be defined by the pc clock. how do I do this?

P.S. I know I've had alot of help from this site since starting this project and I want to thank everyone who's helped me

SysRtcGetTime
This function (see library SysLibRtc.lib) of type DATE_AND_TIME returns the current time which is read from the PC clock.
