here is my problem, im just starting using codesys V2.3 and I like to interlink the codesys to existing PLC controller by TCP/IP but the PLC only acknowledge the bit(i0.0),flagword(FW0) and so on, as you may know the codesys acknowledge C++.1.) how can i communicate by TCP/IP and what are the link i need to do so.2.) how can PLC and Codesys understand each other.in terms of controlling each other.thank.i'm using Festo PLC by the way.

hi,you try to login from CoDeSys to the festo plc (cecx or cpx)or is your problem to connect two plc's and realize some communication between these two?a) there is a scan in the controller configuration you should find the festo plc's´if  they are in the same network.Then set the scanned plc as active and login with your project to the plcIf this does not work the festo support is a good adress to have sucess on that kind of problemsb) Netvars UPD is an Option for communication between plc'shope this helpscuEdwin

hi,ok i summerize:you have a cecx and you are connected via a router?could you ping the cecx if yes the a login should be possible.Netvars is a build in feature which you could enable in the targetsettingsif enabled you could configure a global varable list (properties) add there the UDP communicationcu Edwin
