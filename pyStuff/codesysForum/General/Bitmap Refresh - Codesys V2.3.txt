Hello, Does anyone know how to refresh a bitmap image without resetting the IPC? I found the following post but I believe that is relevant for Codesys V3.5. So the more technical question would be: How do I disable the image cache on Codesys V2.3?viewtopic.php?f=11&t=5829&p=10711&hilit=bitmap#p10711Thank you.

Can you be more specific as to which option? I don't see anything in there that could help me.
