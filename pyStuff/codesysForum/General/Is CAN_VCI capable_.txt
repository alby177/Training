Gentlemen:

I'm trying to use Can@net II, which is a CAN to Ethernet device, to communicate Codesys with my controller, without any luck.
Normally, I use my USB to CAN compact (IXXAT) and this works ok. 

I'm able to use this CAN to Ethernet, with another software, and shows a window where I can specify which interface to use (USB compact or Ethernet), and like I said works ok.

Maybe the CAN_VCI driver is not capable of use this hardware.

Any information to share?

Thanks and Best regards

Be carefull. Maybe someone from CoDeSys can be more specific but IXXAT has multiple versions of the VCI driver. As far as I am aware with CoDeSys V2.3 it supports V2.16 VCI. IXXAT latter released a V3 driver which I believe is not compatible with CoDeSys V2.3 because the driver interface changed. So check and make sure if the CAN @ net supports V2.16 driver and make sure you are using the V2.16 driver. IXXAT allows you to install V2.16 along side V3 driver.
