I've exported an IO Pro 32 program used for an 842 and would like to put it into an 841 controller.  I am using the port 2455 like I was before but I keep getting an Error (#0) when trying to login and download the program.  Here is some data from the attempted download.


---------- Start driver initialization ---------- 
Socket successfully created
Transmit buffer size was set
Receive buffer size was set
connect: Connection timed out
Write attempt from invalid socket
Write attempt from invalid socket
Write attempt from invalid socket
Write attempt from invalid socket
Write attempt from invalid socket

What am I doing wrong?
