Hello All,I have just joined this forum and I would to say hello to all the members. I hope I will get lot of information here.I am using ABB AC500 PLC and Vekio Citec 7.1 for my application. The software platform is obviously CodeSys 2.3. Whenever I am transferring a word to the HMI,it is swapped i.e. Hi word comes as Lo word and vice versa. I guess I need to write a code into CodeSys to swap the word before sending it to the HMI. Can anyone help me out as to how to write the swapping code in codesys ?Thanks in advance

got it from oscat.deswap_byte :=ROL(inword,8);it is rolling over 8 bits just what you want.
