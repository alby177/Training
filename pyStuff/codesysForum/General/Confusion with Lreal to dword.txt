When ever am using this in program, it is supposed to round up the value and give answereg:Lreal_to_dword(in:=(3/5))answer to this is supposed to be 1 but some how in my program it is zero,Can any help me on thisThanksSarath

Maybe (3/5) is handled as an integer first. Which results in 0.Try it with a variable like:Code:var_in: lreal := 0;var_out : dword := 0;var_in = 3 / 5;var_out := Lreal_to_dword(in:=var_in);

rounding up a value is simpler with round from the oscat lib.it is more predictable, and the way it should be done.you are doing a trick and suppose the conversion is good, but a real is totally different from a word.the biggest problem is you do not know how 3 is declared as a byte or as a word or anything.so make all variables declared this way the result is predicatable.
