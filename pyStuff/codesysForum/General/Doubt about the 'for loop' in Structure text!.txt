I am new to structure text and I don't understand how it work. please advise on the code below.

PROGRAM PLC_PRG

VAR
	M1: INT;
	M2: INT:=1;

END_VAR

------------------------------------------------------------------

FOR m1:=1 TO 5 BY 1 DO
	m2:=m2+1;
END_FOR;


this program should run 5 times and m2 should return value 6. 
but it didn't return value 6, and it is still running and adding on
value to m2.  how can it be?....

It is running 5 times for each scan of the program. 

Since the program gets continually scanned,  it will run another 5 times on the 2nd scan, 3rd scan, etc. 

Think of the main program in a PLC as being contained inside a "DO Forever" loop. 
If you want the FOR loop to execute only once, you need to add some sort of condition, perhaps an IF statement around it  

Declair a flag

xRunFor: BOOL := TRUE;

Then in the code...

IF xRunFor THEN
... FOR Loop
 xRunFor := FALSE;
END_IF;

Thanks for your explanation..
