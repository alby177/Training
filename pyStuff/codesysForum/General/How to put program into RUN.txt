Hello all,

Is there a way to put a program into RUN from the Visualization or another application?  If I am reading the help files correctly, there should be a way to use the commands to open a program, show hide, login, then RUN. 

Thanks,
Tom

I am going to make an assumtion. If you already have CoDeSys open to a visualization why would you need access to RUN when the visualization is not active until you Run the application anyways?

There is a way to change the state of the PLC application on a target external to CoDeSys. Some other ways may be PLC manufacturer specific.

You can use DDE see the CoDeSys user manual Chapter 8 DDE interface. This utilizes the CoDeSys gateway server.

Also I believe you can do it directly through the gateway server API. You will have to request that from 3s.

The documents I have don't show that you can stop / start the application only connect / read/ write, but I would guess they are undocumented.

You can put the PLC in RUN by pressing F5 when logged in (ALT+F8) through CoDeSys. Or by going to the menu "Online -> RUN".

IFM do a program called "downloader" it is posible to run the PLC without even having to go into CoDeSys at all.

If you're trying to make an interface for others to make it easier for them to communicate with, download and run your program then that is the way to do it. it's so simple that even a monkey with a wrench could do it.

The visualisation tool is more for being able to select and deselect variables in a diagnostics way. we use a generic diagnostics window created on our first program with just an input toggle and the outputs it effects on it's right side.

hope that helps.

the plc should be in run as nothing is updated when not.
however it is possible to use a button to start and stop pou within the program task.

Tomasz is correct look in the library SysLibPLcCtrl.lib. I have posted it here for clarity. 

Also see my post on CoDeSys from thumb drive. I stated there is a CST tool that CoDeSys has in case your MFG doesn't have anything like the IFM Downloader.
