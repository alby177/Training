hello 

I am using CNC editor for the motion (x,y & Z co-ordinates). Just after SMC_Interpolator i am using "SMC_TRAFO_Gantry3". Now i want 
get control on the anuglar motion of the spindle. I want to ask two questions 

1. what word should i use for angular movement like we use "X" word for X-axis movement , "Y" word for Y-axis movement and so on. 
2. what block should i use after "SMC_Interpolator" , so that i can control my angular movement as well 

thankx 
Best regards 
Tahir
