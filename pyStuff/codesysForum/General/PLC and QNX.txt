Hi people!

I have some questions about running PLC under QNX.
I would like to know what I´m doing wrong, because I can´t connect with the runtime.
First of all, I created de TSP for QNX and installed the target successfully.
I have the runtime system running in the QNX computer.
Then I configured the communication parameters. I´m using local gateway server and TCP/IP communication channel.
When I try to LOGIN, this messages shows up "The selected PLC profile does not match the profile of the target! The connection will be canceled.".
I noticed that the runtime accept the client, but then reject the connection because of this problem.

It´s clear that I´m doing some crap! hehehehe
What else I have to do to fix it??? I read the manual but I can´t figure out the problem.

Best regards!

Hi Marcio,

The message means the target ID inside your runtime and the target ID inside your target files are different.

Hi Ralph,

Thanks for helping me!
Well, I received a target range from 3s-software and the QNX runtime(binary only). From this range I choosed a target ID and created the target file. How can I set the target ID that I choosed inside my runtime? Do I have to edit rts3s.cfg???
As you can see I´m quite lost...hehehe

Regards!

That seems my help was not really helpfull. But your question seems like getting started questions. You schould ask them to your dedicatet 3S developer. 
OK - He is currently in holidays  but will be back at the beginning of september.  

Things are really confused!!! I don´t want to flood you with questions! I will wait for Mr. Zauner come back from vacation.
Thanks a lot anyway Ralph!
Regards
