Hello fractalmind,

yes it's possible.

Use the follow link to find the application note A300000
http://www.wago.com/wagoweb/documentati ... wn___e.htm

There you can find a discription what you have to do for dataexchange
between two 842.
You can do this also with the 841.


If you want to get more information about modbus and dataexchange
then you can visit the application note A300003. 
You can find it at the link above too.

Uwe

...  thanks   Uwe  is what I was looking for .....
