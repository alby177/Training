hi..

im so new at codesys..i wanna ask a question..at pisture u see a diagram from another programme of ladder..can we do same it at codesys and how?  i couldnt done it..



Hello,

Of course everything is possible to be done, doesn't matter Codesys or Siemens environment. Ladder is the same - look at 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ladder_logic

Best regards,[/url]

please make two lines of it 
it has a better overview and better practice to have one output in aline.
however it is possible in codesys
just click the output twice and it will be in parallel.
