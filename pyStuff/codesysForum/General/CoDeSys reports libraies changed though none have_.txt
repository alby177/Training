How to tell which library is causing change-notification when I open a project?-----Running 2.3.9.37 on two different computers.CoDeSys reports differences in libraires when compiled on one, and opened on hte other.So, easy right?  I just have to have a mismatch in target or something right?But its not so easy   I have checked EVERY file including the target-directory in:   C:\Program Files (x86)\3S Software\CoDeSys V2.3\     (This includes the Target)Checking was done using a SourceTree application (Mecurial), and also by just comparing a 'DIR /S' dump's - NO files are different except:\CoDeSys.ini (And this is just which project was opened last etc).ALL other files are identical including all library files. I have some libraires in sub-folders of the project, but these are referenced relatively by '.\lib' so they are also the same.Any suggestions?

they must be fully identical even the datestamp.When i make a system i copy all files (and libs on a stick and put it in the manual.

Well thats the thing - everything is identical - even the file-dates.That I have checked with "CompareIt" on the output of DIR /S of the Target, Project and CodeSys directories...If I compile on a computer with the change-notification, then it can just go online, so apparently the resulting binarycode is completely identical.....

even if you save the pro file it sees, a change, so first save the file (it is a option before compiling)and keep it away from any change. That is only way to be sure. as soon as the * is seen on the filename, it can go wrong.(same for the libs)
