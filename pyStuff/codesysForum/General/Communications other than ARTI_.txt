I'm wondering if there are other ways to communicate with a CoDeSys controller over ethernet than ARTI?  

We have a Bosch Rexroth drive resident controller that we cannot communicate with using a Beijer Exter panel which has an ARTI driver.   HOWEVER, we have been able to communicate with it using Bosch Rexroth's panel (a private labeled Seutron panel) and also with the Galileo Software from MicroInnovation.  

Is there some older protocol that would use the symbol file but not be based on ARTI?  

We are trying to collect information to help Beijer write a drier for this controller but not getting very far.

Any help or suggestions appreciated.
