hello:

       I have a little question.please help.what's the meaning of "SEL"?
thanks very much.

It is a selection function.
You change the state of the output with an boolean input.
The Variables In1 and In2 can be of any kind

example in ST

IF YourBooleanVariable THEN
  YourOutPutVariable:=YourInputVariable1;
ELSE
  YourOutPutVariable:=YourInputVariable2;
END_IF

Some call it a "Analog switch"
