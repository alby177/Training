Is it possible to connect 3rd party application with CoDeSys Simulation? Same like SIEMENS does with S7PLCSIM?

If i want to simulate my application with S7 PLC Simulation, it is possible with Siemens STEP7  software using S7PLCSim.

Is there any similar module available in CoDeSys? or any plan to support in near future? 

I generally use the online simulation to simulate a project.

I add a POU to simulate my process I/O and how it reacts and then add it as a task or just call it from the main program.

Generally there are a bunch of time delays so when output X goes on, you wait a little and turn input Y on.  For instance to simulate a limit switch that senses when a cylinder has extended. 

I haven't done any really large systems this way but it works great for small system.

I do it the same way, however, not in CoDeSys simulation. Beckhoff TwinCAT works better.
You can download a royalty free trial version from the Beckhoff website (works for 30 days, then you will have to reinstall it for the next 30 days). It comes with a Win based soft PLC, which you can use even at the development PC. 
Opposite to CoDeSys simulation, timings and task management are working in hard realtime.
TwinCAT is suitable for large projects as well.

With CoDeSys you have a PLC soft too, CoDeSys SP PLCWinNT, you can use it without licence during 2 hours. After 2 hours you only to re start again ! 
This PLC is fully usefull; For example I use it to simulate a process, and J use network variables with Ethernet to link this softPLC and a real PLC from Moeller.
Best regards
