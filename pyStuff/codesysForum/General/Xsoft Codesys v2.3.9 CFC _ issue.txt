HelloI am used to Simatic step7 and it's great CFC feature. Now I am using CodeSys and I find it hard to get an overview in the CFC interface. There is a _ function in the toolbar, but it only works down to 106%. Why is this?Is there a workaround? My view is full after adding a few blocks and you really loose the good overview when you have to keep scrolling down the page.I see there is some improvement in the new codesys v3(more like step7), but Eaton has not yet implemented it to it's product line. Anyone know anything about this?thanks

Yes you are correct the _ function is not working as it should be.when _ there will be another number as you have given.it is in the program for long time >5 years this is in error.roland can you please give an answer to this problem?a work around for this is using macrosi tend to do the programming as vetical as possible thus start on left side again, when i have a new scrolling down is easy.

Thanks for the replyOk, maybe they have a reason for not fixing it..  I have just tried the macro function and it might be a way to make it more tidy,  my plan is to write function blocks in ST and then connect everything together in CFC. Doing this I hope to make the program easy to read and troubleshoot. Is CFC commonly used in CodeSys? The reason I ask is because it seems a bit unfinished and unpolished, especially if you compare it to CFC in simatic step7. Again I see they have borrowed some features from step7 in in codesys v3.x but I still miss a lot of features.Kim Andre

Your way with ST inside CFC is done most of times.however a lot of people just work in ST (the guys in communication) and the old people work in ladder.No CFC is not used widely however the complete base of it can be used.What feature is in S7 present and not possible to make in CFC?I use CFC a lot and combine it with FBD and most real code is written in ST.
