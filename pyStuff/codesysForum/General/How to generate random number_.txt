Dear editor,Regarding GEN_RDM FB gathered from Oscat library, I found that FB would only be able to be called twice. More than twice calling, the third one would not be proceeded.Is this issue related to limitation of a PC as a simulation controller? Thank you in advance for your information.Kind regards,Aditya PrabowoJakarta, ID

i can not find any limitation, btw this is old post.and this question belongs in the oscat forum.
