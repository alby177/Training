Hello everybody:

I'm not able to connect to my controller using Canopen, perhaps I am able thru serial. I tested the converter (usb-to-can, IXXAT) with other devices and it is working ok. 
My concern is that I installed previously a Codesys demo version from the website, which I unistalled before I used my Codesys 2.3., and this messed up the gateway.
I would appreciate any comment or advice, in order to solve this.

Best regards

What type of PLC are you working with? I believe for all PLC's, at least for mine, that CoDeSys communicates to the PLC using SDO's. Your PLC should be configured to have two different ID's. One for control network and one for communication with CoDeSys. Are you sure you have the same ID configured on the PLC and in the CoDeSys gateway? My PLC defaults to ID 32, which I change once I download code to it. I also use the IXXAT usb to can compact. Did you ever get CoDeSys to communicate to the PLC over CAN or are you talking about using MinMon to view CAN buss data? If you think the install messed something up un-install and reinstall.

Thanks Steve:

I am using KU-R03P, from AMK. I don't know exactly how  the communication with the PLC is, but works with another computer, using the same configuration, and not with mine.
I already unistalled and reinstalled it again, with no results.
I see data in the canopen bus using the minimon.
This why Im trying to troubleshoot the gateway.
