Can anyone please help me understand better the PID Function block.I can't seem to find much on the internet that makes sense and the Help file within Codesys is totally useless.I understand the principles of it.Can I get an example of how to set up my block?Let's say its for a central cooling/heating system.Range is 0 - 25 (*C)If below 10*C = turn on heater If above 20*C = turn on fanSetpoint = 15*CI need it to slow down the cooling/heating or close the valves slowly as it approaches setpoint.Actual = "read_from_meter"SET_POINT = 15KP = ???TN = ???Y_OFFSET = ???Y_MIN = 10Y_MAX = 20MANUAL = "man_button:=BOOL"RESET = "reset_button:=BOOL"Any help would be great.Thanks

what function block are yoiu using? the one in util, or the one from oscat.defirst only use the P then add I until it starts oscilating.

In Codesys the Y_Min/Max increases as the Actual_Value decreases and vise versa.KP:= Proportional normally set at 1;TN:= The integral part normally set from 1 and above;TV:= The Derivative action and normally set at 1Does this heater has a analog control either 4-20mA or 0-10VDC reference signal?Cause I would use a Hysteresis Control or IF statements  to drive digital outputs rather than using  a PID controller.

Hi If you are doing dynamic winding upyou can use FT_PIDW from OSCATIt is helpful
