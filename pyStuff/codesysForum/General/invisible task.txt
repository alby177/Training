Hello!
I want to create invisible to user task in my library (like CANOpen library task).

How I can do that?

on objects in visualisation, there is a parameter which is setable to make the object invisible based on a bool variable. double click the object in the visualisation and click on the "variables" tab. the top option will allow you to do this.

As far i understood i.e you would like to create a Functions and Function Blocks, where should not able to see your function code.to achieve above, Create a external library, that is in C.Thanks and Regards,Rajesh G
