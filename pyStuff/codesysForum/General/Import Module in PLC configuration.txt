Hello everyone,

I am not able to import a module into the PLC configuration.  In the config file the EXPORTABLE is set to TRUE for this module.  I am able to export it to an XML but I am not able to import it back in.  (See attahced JPG) I have also changed the MaxNum in the config file to allow more than 1 module.  

Does anyone have suggestions or ideas?

I am working with 2.3.5.8. 


Thanks,
Tom
