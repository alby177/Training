Hello,I am having trouble deleting an entry in the communications parameters option on CoDeSys v2.3.9.11.  Is there a INI file I can edit with a text editor to delete these entries manually?The PLC I use will not allow me to log in unless I remove the entries which are one off of the root tree.  Please see attached BMP a better view.Attachment:comm_param.JPGKind regards,Doug Rilee

Removing from that list should just be a case of left clicking on the one you want to remove and clicking the remove button. I'm unsure as to the problem you are having as most of these parameters are ignored (except the one you're using). Just out of curiosity, when you try to change a function in that window such as baudrate, do you click update before ok? Sorry I couldn't be more help.

Unfortunatly this is the problem.  I have no problem in other projects deleting these communication parameter settings, but I have some kind of glitch inside CoDeSys that prevents me from deleting these.  I can even have others included with the  CAN_Open_IF and delete them easily. Doug

Try out next steps:1) Close Codesys and Gateway 2) Open file CoDeSys.ini 3) Locate the string DefaultDevice= <very big hex-string>4) Clear value of this parameter5) Save CoDeSys.ini 6) Open Codesys and check Communication Parameters (I got absolutely blank one)Good luck!

Hi All,I have the same problem here, I already did the procedure that our colleague Avgur said, but I am still have this problem...There are many Instances that I cannot remove although the 'Remove' button is enabled.If someone has a solution, please help me.
