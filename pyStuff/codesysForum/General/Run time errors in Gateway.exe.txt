I'm consistently getting run time errors in Gateway.exe:

R6025
- pure virtual function

After that, Gateway.exe crashes, so no communication with target possible.

Is there anyone that knows what's causing them?

AFAIK calling pure virtual functions is a programming error in the Gateway.exe.

It seems that the problem has to do with installation/configuration of my PC. On another PC there's no problem.

Is there any list of DLLs (including versions), registry entries that are used by Gateway.exe, so that I can check a few things?

Thanks,
