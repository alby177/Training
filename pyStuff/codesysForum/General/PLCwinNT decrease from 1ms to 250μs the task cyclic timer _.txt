Hi all,I want , decrease from 1ms to 250Î¼s the cyclic timer main task in PLCwinNT version 2.4.I possibile and if the answer is yes ...how I can do!!!Thx a lot !!Felix

the only way in V2.3 is to use freewheeling, however this will give problems with other tasks.communication will slow down tasks.try to find a wayto slow down the requirment liike doing different way of control depending on type of operation.you can use a raspberry Pi. that is also codesys and 1000 times faster as aPLC
