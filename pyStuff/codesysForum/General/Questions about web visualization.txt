Hello, I participate to the CoDeSys user conference in Grenoble and I was really interested by the conference. Thanks again for all.

I would like more details about the web visualisation:

Is it possible to use another web server like Apache or IIS?
Do you provide the 3S web server for porting to a specific platform like you do for the CoDeSys SP?

Best
