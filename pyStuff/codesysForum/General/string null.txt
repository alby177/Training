Hello,
In laser marker protocol i have to send to it with serial comunication three string null ($00) but when i concact three $00 the result is only one string null.

Ex:

StringExample:STRING:='$00$00$00';

the result string before send is StringExample:='';

Regards
Stefano

In string operations, the null character signifies the end of the string when displaying the string the first null tells the program the string is done. 

I'm not sure if the concat will work or not. 

I would try to send three BYTEs with a value of 0 (which is the same as the null character.

Thanks,

i'll try it

StringExample:STRING:='$00$00$00' is equal to StringExample:='' (null string) and Code:SysComWrite(dwHandleCom,ADR(StringExample),LEN(StringExample),0) send NOTHING to COM port.You have to use array of bytes instead of string.For example:Code:VAR arr1:ARRAY[1..3] OF BYTE:=3(0); writed:DWORD;END_VARwrited:=SysComWrite(dwHandleCom,ADR(arr1),3,50);
