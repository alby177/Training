I have an application inCodesys that automatically start with windows and also do a login to the PLC, it works nicely.But now and then my network is unstable (or overloaded) and the application lose connection to the PLC, so I wounder if there is a way to make the application trying to re-login to the PLC if connection is lost?

what is the PC running is it also codesys running or only a visualisation coming from the PLC.

the simplest way is to use a watchdog in the PLC, and switch off the PC when it happens, if only comms fail you can reboot the system with software boot program.
