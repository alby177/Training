Hello.When I download my project from CoDeSys 2.3 to the PLC during loggin I also download a symbol file. After i Installed Bosch Rexroth IndraWorks 13V12 I had problem with the gateway. The symbol file and the Default.PRG file is not downloaded. I get the Error message "The last online service has not been executed correctly! Service Number: 48, Error number: 80, File Default.PRG could not be written." When I install the Gateway program on a remote computer, then the symbol file and the Default.PRG file is downloaded. The troubble started when I installed IndraWorks. Any ideeas?

as you well know, both are codesys products, so the driver is different, but the main program is the same.You can only have 1 codesys on your computer.
