I'm glad I found this forum on the internet. I'm building the prototype of a new machine in our house in Phoenix, AZ, USA. The machine will utilize a new LM 3108 PLC from China and a Weintek 6050i HMI. The HMI uses Easybuilder. The PLC uses CoDeSys. I've been successful programming the HMI with touch screens, but writing programs in CoDeSys with the PLC software manual has been a struggle. I know the HMI will operate as the master, and the PLC as the slave in MODBUS RTU. I'm sure I can write the PLC program with enough self-study. But for now, I don't know how to integrate the HMI program into the LD program for the PLC.

use markers (%M0.1) etc.you can ask them in your HMI.

I'm still trying some things. The problem is: to establish communication between the HMI and the PLC. I've built the assembly in the photo, so I can write short programs to turn the motor on and off. I've been reading the software manuals for the PLC and the HMI for the past few months. It would be a big success to start the motor by touching a button on the touch screen of the HMI.

Attached are screen shots of the Codesys program and the HMI program. I know I haven't entered some of the necessary data in the Codesys Program. I'm still studying the software.

Here is the Codesys screen shot.

Codesys is easy to program so u can tell roughly what sort of sequence you are looking for?Trust me try ST,FB and SFC instead of Ladder logic you will succeed fast

Thanks. I've found a programmer who is helping me online at Elance.com.

aha i saw your elance but did not react on it.i see %QX0.0 that should be coil_1where is the motor_on FB in the POU list.there should be a POU called PLC_PRGi see VAR CONSTANTbut all u use should be under VARhere your list like Coil_1END_VARgive the function block another name as the program itself.start with simpler oneadd POUit will start with PLC_PRGset the type on ladderVARstartbutton at %MX0.0 :BOOL; (* this is address 40000 *)input1 AT %IX0.0 :BOOL; (* this is an input on the PLC, if active the output should go on when everything is correct *)output1 AT %QX0.0 :BOOL;   (* this is your coil *)END_VARprogramstartbutton as a contactmake a extra input and OR it with your startbuttonOR input1 and output1 as the coilgo onlineit will ask to download the programgo to startnow program is runningmake input1 active.and yes you can PM meshooter@home.nl however i like it via this forum so others can see what is happening and learn from it.

Thanks very much for your help. I'm in the middle of the process of collaborating with an experienced programmer in India. We're using teamviewer. I sent your information to him.

sent the program by exporting it to me and i will have a look, please make lots of comments in your program so i can see what you like to have.if flowsheet available pleaseand what should the unclear picture do?

It's okay. I'm working online with the other programmer on Elance. He is very experienced, and I'm sure we'll succeed.
