No admins have an email address associated with them? I can't figure it out on the board.I had over 200 posts accredited to my name now I only have a few. What happened to my post numbers and status?Sorry I couldn't figure out how to get to an admin?

Hi,you can contact me under r.wagner@3s-software.com .I am sorry concerning the problem with the number of posts. It happened due to an update of the forum. We will try to recover the number, but this might take a certain time...
