Hello,

As Microsoft has recently launched Windows 7 and has already declared End of Support dates for Windows Xp, so we need to know compatibility of CoDeSys V2.3.x.x and V3.x.x.x with Windows 7.

Recently, a basic test with CoDeSys V2.3 and V3 was successfully realized under Win7 (32 Bit). Even if we intend to run a regression test soon, we are fully conv√≠nced that CoDeSys can be used under Win7.

Please note that the 64 bit platforms are NOT yet supported.
