This is not problem in codesys, it is the problem generated by the PLC hardware when you are trying to communicate.It can be easily resolved, please follow the below steps1. Reset the PLC to original and follow the procedure to download the OS, before downloading just erase the complete ladder code and source code2. After downloading the OS just download the program again.If the problem still continues then change the programming cableRegardsBalaji
