Hello EveryoneI Am experimenting with function blocks ( FB(HTTP_GET) AND FB(YAHOO_WEATHER) in the Oscat library to import  XML data from websites .In my case I want to get a weather forecast in XML datawhen I connect to a site used also in the FB YAHOO_WEATHER I will get XML data from  website http://weather.yahooapis.com/forecastrssWhat wonders me when I connect to the website http://xml.buienrader.nl I get sometimes a response and sometimes I don't even get connected.And I have t o wait for an hour or so to make a successful connection again.But when I connect with a browser like Internet explorer I get response on the flyI know that that the size of the response is bigger than the response of the site http://weather.yahooapis.com/forecastrssand I had to alter the Some FB to make a bigger buffer size possible But never the less this is not the problem ( I Think )the maximum buffer-size was limited to 32767 bytes due the use of integers as buffer array indexes the buffer size needed for a http response from the url http://xml.buienrader.nl is 42kbAt this moment I don't have a clue what is coursing the problemSo if someone has a good idea I'm interestedKind Regards
