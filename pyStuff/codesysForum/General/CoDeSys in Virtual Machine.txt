Has anyone tried running CoDeSys programming software from XP running in VM on e.g linux- Ubuntu ?

would be interested to know this also.  If no replies, I will try it later this week

Hello,

I haved tried it using VMWare Fusion on a Mac, it shouldn't be any big difference on a Linux system. If remember correctly I tried to write a small program, download and run it on a PLCWinNT.

I've been using CoDeSys in VMWare for a long time on Linux.  There are no hassles at all!  I've even tried running the SP RTE a few times, and that works quite well too.

This is a life saver because I heavily (read: always!) use Linux, and I don't want to dual boot just for one program!

HTH.

I have installed CoDeSys (Wago IO Pro CAA) in wine under Linux Ubuntu 8,04.
It seems to run fine, but I haven't  tested on-line mode yet.
But I was very pleased to discover this!

wow, I would be interested to hear your success, if you can upload software and do the usual online tasks.  Last time I tried I couldn't get it to work, but wine has improved a lot since then!
