Hi there,I have both ABB's version and SEW's version of CoDeSys installed on my computer.  The ABB version was first.  Codesys installs as part of the Control Builder package.  Everything was working fine, I had the visualisation tab in the browser window and was able to make and edit visualisations for commissioning. When I installed Motion Studio from SEW the visualisation tab disappeared in both the ABB version and the SEW version.  I suspect that visualisations are not part of the SEW package but I am not sure how to get them back.  Has anybody else had a similar experience and how did you solve it?Thanks, RussellVersion is 2.3.9.40
