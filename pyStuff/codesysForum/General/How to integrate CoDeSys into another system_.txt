Hi All
We want to develop a software based on CoDeSys. To be accurate, based on part of CoDeSys. Here is the detail:
1. The user can input/edit PLC-code via interface of CoDeSys;
2. The PLC-code can be compiled with our(!) compiler but not CoDeSys's compiler;
3. Soft PLC runtime is not needed because the PLC-code is compiled into some other language and won't run on CoDeSys PLC.

In a word, what we need is the function of human-manchine interface and precompile.
Is it feasible? Would you present some documents? Thank you!
