What a new beautifull forum   I use the english version and after I login myself, many informations and options are written in ... Deutch   I have trouble reading English, so you think it's worse in German   I think it is a youthful   Best regards from France

Quote:I use the english version and after I login myself, many informations and options are written in ... Deutch Sorry for the inconveniences. During the upgrade the personal language preferences have been lost.   BUT: we will try to fix the problem today.In case you want to help yourself, please see the following link: http://forum-en.3s-software.com/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=1597 (my 2nd post)

The problem should be fixed.Please do not hesitate to contact me in case you find anything else which is strange or corrupt. But of course I hope that we are through   .  By the way - now it is possible to follow the different forum threads in general. I hope this might be useful for you  And there are some more useful improvements which made the trouble worth.@Shooter:Unfortunately it is not possible to unite the different forums in just one. Even if most of the users understand English quite well, there are on the other hand a lot who prefer much more to communicate in there mother's language. Even my people ...  Thank you for your understanding ...
