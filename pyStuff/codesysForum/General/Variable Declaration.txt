Hello,I am new to CoDeSys...What is the difference between VAR_INPUT, VAR_OUTPUT, VAR_IN_OUT

_________________Subrahmanya Hegde

variables are in different status available:normal vars only work within a function block (or program)inputs are used to get data from outside the blockoutputs are used to give data to other blocks.in/out can be used in both directions.just give it a try.if any questions just ask here no problem.

May I respectfully add that variables listed under the VAR_IN_OUT declaration are passed by reference rather than by value.  This fact means that a programmer can address large pieces of data (arrays, structures) inside a function or function block without needlessly increasing actual consumed memory by the implicit copy that is performed when using VAR_INPUT and VAR_OUTPUT.Kind regards,The Captive Engineer
