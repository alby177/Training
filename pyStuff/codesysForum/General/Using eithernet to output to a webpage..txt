Hi I'm new to Codesys. What I'm trying to do is create a RFID door entry system. I have the control side done and the relay triggers upon reading a valid ID card. I'd like to take it a step further and take the result string (the card number read) and export the value to a webpage that will show who is in the building.

Any ideas?

Hello,

You can use a tcp-socket to connect to the webserver and send a GET message, but you have to build entire http request you're self

if you google on raw http request you can find some interesting info

example
connect to the server (port 80) and request a php file (in this case on the root) that handles the message

send the next message in the tcp-socket
GET door.php?guestID=number of the card as string HTTP/1.1\n\r

guestID is the var in the php file

I think this should work, its a long time ago that I used it
