Yet another silly question here  I need to send ascii characters over FMS. My sae1939 lib data input is ARRAY 0..1600 of byteMostly using FBD-s to program, i got a block to convert ascii text to ARRAY 0..100 of byteHow do i assign the array of 0...100 to 1500...1600Getting "Cannot convert array 0...100 of byte to array of 0..1600 of byte" or if i try to define [1500..1600] then i get error "Expecting "," or " before """so how to assign arrays of different size and how to point the locations (with single byte locations defining like [2] etc seems to work fine)

Short of copying the bytes directly, maybe you can use use POINTER TO BYTE as an in-between.  For example, define pData : POINTER TO BYTE. Then pData := ADR(Array[1500]).  Now you have the address of the data at position 1500 in the array. Now maybe you can do you work based on pData instead of your array[0..100].

Thank you!

a string has a limited length so direct will not work, as scott says use for this a pointerand have a look at how oscat is solving strings.
