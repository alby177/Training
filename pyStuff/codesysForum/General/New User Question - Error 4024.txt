I'm sure this is very obvious, but I'm new to CodeSys trying the Traffic Signal tutorial program and I'm stuck on this error:
Error 4024:Variable_Configuration(1) Expecting VAR_GLOBAL before 'VAR_INPUT'

My config is:

VAR_INPUT
   STATUS:INT;
VAR_OUTPUT
  GREEN:BOOL;
  YELLOW:BOOL;
  RED:BOOL;
END_VAR

No matter where I insert VAR_GLOBAL, it still fails. Any ideas?

global variables are in a special section on resources.
easier way is when you type in a vriable name and auto is on the first field is where it should go and give it global.

i always make first work of these global variables.
i put all real inputs from %IX and %QX on these global ones so i can find them allways.
btw system does same when you config it.

In "Variables Configuration" section, the keyword VAR_CONFIG is expected.

Putting them in Global Variables solved the problem, thanks for the help!
