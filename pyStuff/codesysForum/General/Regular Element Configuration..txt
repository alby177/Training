I have made a button on the screen for the puropose of being able to switch between visualisations. the idea behind this is that I can have a front page where I can access all other visualisations. I figure in order to link the button to the visualisation I'd have to put the visualisations name somewhere in the regular elements configuration box. 
Can someone let me know where.
thanks

Never mind, I figured it was the _ to viz option. It seems really obvious now. oops :p
