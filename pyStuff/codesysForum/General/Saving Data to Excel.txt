I'm using an EC-CPU201 to monitor steam usage.  I have the data stored as UINT and converted to STR and also displayed on a digital display as ASCII characters through Com 2.

Is there a way I can save the data in legible format as an Excel file to MMC and to USB?  I have code setup for saving daily totals to MMC and hourly totals for a month at a time to retentive memory and I have code to allow a dump of retentive to a USB.  But I've been saving the string values  a TXT file ewxtention, but the results are useless - not at all what I expected.

I desire to save the values into individual cells for each hour or each day in an Excel file.  Could someone explain to me how I would do this?  Also, is a String variable the wrong format to save to such a file?  I would appriciate any help I could get to do this.

Hi,

for our application also we need to save the alarms in Excel file format..but what we did is we saved the text file as .CSV format and we seperated the each columns by "," then we had opend the content in Excel file..

i guess this will work...

can you give me code to write some data in to the USB device...
Is there any library available to write or read the USB device dirctly from the Code..

I can pass along to you what a Moeller Engineer sent me.  It's really pretty straight forward and very similar to using the mmc card.  I don't know how to turn off the USB device before removing though.  If you figure that out maybe you could clue me in on it or if I find out how I will post it for you.  Hope this is a help to you.
