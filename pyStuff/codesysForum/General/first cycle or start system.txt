Hi, I used CoDeSys (ABB-PLC)

I’m beginner in CoDeSys. 
I want to used something to get information now is first cycle. (Understand me) for example in Simatic – SM0.1 (First step)

I see system events – start. I try to create, but didn’t work. 

Lot of thanks

Hello Paul,

some Simple Steps:

1. Create the POU wich you want to execute by start-event. (Best way try it with a simple adder so that on every start 1 is added )

2. Check the checkbox in front of system event start
3. Click in the same row in column called POU
4. Use F2 Key to select your start POU

thats all.
By the way don't use simulation mode. Simulation mode does not support system events. You must test your project with a real hardware.
