Hello again!

I am about to write certain things to a Tera Term Pro file from my PLC (CoDeSys-program). But when I am trying to get a nice look on thing for example by using '$n' in the string it does not come out well (I just want it to do a line change but it does a line feed). Does someone know why the string constants does not work the way I expect them to or does someone know what type of String Constants to use in CoDeSys to get a nice formate in Tera Term Pro?

I would be very helpful for any help,
Sofia.

Hi sz,

did you use both '$R$N' already?

Kind Regards
