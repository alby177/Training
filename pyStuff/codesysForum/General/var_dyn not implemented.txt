Hi Everyone, Im recently new to the 61131 standard and codesys, but have 30 years programming experience. I have noticed the standard defines a VAR_DYN block which allows dynamic/temporary allocation of variables (using the stack mechanism). However, codedsys seeems not to have implemented this feature, so all variables are static. I have scoured the documentation and the net and can find no references to this.
   I am using codesys 2.3.6 (i have no choice here). Have I missed something, or has this requirement never been implemented?

thanks all
simon

Try to use functions from SysLibMem library (if your hardware manufacturer implemented it in your PLC). Allocate memory and use it as you want.
