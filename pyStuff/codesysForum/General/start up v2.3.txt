Hi recantly started to use this software and one thing I notice is that upon start up it always opens a project previously opened is there any way to re-route this to open a template or anything other than last job.

options load uncheck autoload.

another way is to use rightclick on a pro file and it will open that one.

first use a new program then uncheck it, no need to save it (as far as i know)

what codesys are you using?

that is very old9 years, but if the PLC is running on it, leave it like it is.Some newer software will not always work with old PLC types as there is a program in rom, and impossible to upgrade it.

where do you start the codesys? on desktop by icon, in program files under 3s software or....

so now you now where it starts.if you uncheck this autoload it should work the next time.no need for saving, just close it without saving.another way is to make a new programput in PLC_PRG nothing:=true; and next time it wil start with this one.So working with IFM, do you have manual from IFM?available on the net.https://www.ifm.com/img/Codesys_user_v2.3.pdfand yes help is no problem.

I am finding this software very frustrating and this is only one of the issues we have with it some are known to be down to policey's set up on the companys computer system, I'm wondering if this problem is also caused by the same.

There are millions of users of codesys software, and they seem to be happy, apart from the siemens users.Go to the directory C:\Program Files\ifm electronic\CoDeSys V2.3\Codesys.exe and start this program.when it starts with a old program, start a new project.answer some questions about target etc.Then in the PLC_PRG write nothing:=true;save the programexit codesys.now start up codesys again and check wich program is shown.If it is nothing.pro uncheck the autoload, exit and try again.if this does not help zip or rar the contents of the folder (i know it is big) and use wetransfer.com to send it to me, and i will have a look at it.If it does help, but when you use the icon on desktop, check the icon.It is very difficult to take over from somebody, he has made a system and you have no clue how he has done it.The software is straight forward, but it has some bends, and i will help you getting acquainted with it.other ways are http://www.sps-forum.de/forum.phpplcs.netand yes i do have skype and email.

When you say when you say "send contents of folder" do you mean the one that keeps opening or the new one?

to be sure send the complete codesys directory called C:\Program Files\ifm electronic\i hope the projects are part of this directory, if not please send the projects folder too.

Now I am unable to zip up the codesys directory company has the system locked up so much it refuses to let me do anything, then the Projects folder is on what we know as a "G" drive and is a portition on the companys computer system the folder has in it approx 1400 files and 55 folders also. I'm wondering if we should just draw line under the lot, upgrade to latter version and start again,

Please keep the old version as this allows you to see online running, when using newer version this will be impossible.same for libs and programs.For each installation i make a sticky, with everything on, just to be sure i can get back to the installed system.It is no great problem to use external drives, however it is a risk to do so.In version 2.3 was no versioncontrol, in version3 there is.Make very sure you can compile to the version that is used in the PLC's .Even the smallest change in program or a library (even a date/time stamp) will give problems and the PLC will say program is different from existing one,  downloading again, and if not carefull, you will loose recipes, hourmeters setups speeds times etc.First of all i would recommend to make a copy of all the directories that are used in the ifm system, probably giving lots of doubles but dont care.Then make for each programmed PLC, a directory with the needed files (archive).It is a common problem to cleanup and sort all these old files.Use a separate computer (laptop) to play with codesys, that way you can not damage original files, and dont be afraid to to get familiar.1400 files is not too much to zip them.And yes for newer projects better to make a new setup, ask ifm if they will give you latest version of the software.You can also use the demo codesys from codesys.com, only install it in another directory, it will work just fine.Hoping i can still be of a help to you.
