Does anyone have a library for sending an email from within CoDeSys?
If I am using a target that is a windows CE box can I make an external program call to run a command line email program?

Yes, that is possibly by the function SendMail() contained in the library SysLibAlarmTrend.lib.

Yes I have done it and works fine. The SendEmail() function also is good unfortunately isn't working for server requires authentification.

Is the SysLibAlarmTrend.lib only for v2.3?
I cant find the lib in CoDeSys SP 3.1.1.0 Runtime System Reference.pdf.
I am too interested in the possibilities of CodeSys V3.2+ of sending email/SMS and also communicating via GSM.
Regards Björn!

I am not so sure about what's in the pfd documentation but I am working with 2.3.2.7 and the SysLibAlarmTrend.lib exists.
As I said, I have developed FBs (using Sockets lib) and I am able to send/receive email (with authorization) and also SMS through wireless GPRM modem (Blue Tree)....
