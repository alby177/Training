Dear All, I would like to save data in txt file for plotting by Matlab. Following code I am using but result is not that one I want I have shifted to right in each row: PROGRAM PLC_PRGVAR	hFile: DWORD;	szFilePath: STRING:= 'C:\ay.txt';	wNewLine: ARRAY[1..20] OF STRING;	(*wNewLine:STRING;*)	dwWritten:DWORD;	CloseFile: BOOL;	ay:STRING;	i: INT:= 1 ;	strString:STRING;	Lenght: INT;	SizeoFile: DINT;END_VARhFile := SysFileOpen(szFilePath, 'a');WHILE (i <> 30) DO	ay :=INT_TO_STRING(i);	dwWritten:= SysFileWrite(hFile, ADR(ay), SIZEOF(ay));	strString := CONCAT(ay, '$R$L');	i := i+1;END_WHILELenght := LEN(strString);(*Close the Opened File*)CloseFile :=  SysFileClose(hFile);SizeoFile := SysFileGetSize(szFilePath);Result in ay.txt file I am looking for: 1              2                3                       4                            5                                                                                                                  6 ...30RESULT I GOT:

you write to file var ay which doesn't contain CRLF, write strString instead

pnn wrote:you write to file var ay which doesn't contain CRLF, write strString insteadHi, Thanks for your reply, How can perform CRLF in CodeSys  . I solved the problem with "CONCAT" and "$R$N". And now I have problem how to save data in 2 columns in excel file. In such way that if I could plot each column.

put a comma in between the columns so it will be a CDFand check your string length strstring:string(3);
