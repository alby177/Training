HiThe "Search" tool disappeared and in the English version there are some buttons and options which are displayed in German.

Hi everybody,in fact the search is now at the bottom line. I will try to move it up again ... And the problem with the German options is a general one: As it seams the preference for the board languages were lost for all (non german) users during the upgrade.I apologize that!!!   In order to switch back to your preferred language please follow these instructions:* Click on the link "Personlicher Bereich" (Personal settings / my account) right above the date and time display.* The forum software opens the personal settings of your account.* Please click on the menu on the left side under "Optionen" on the link "Einstellungen" (settings)* The settings dialog is opened. One of the settings is in the line "Meine Sprache" (my preferred language). In the drop down menu you will find the entry "German"* Please choose your preferred language.* Confirm the settings with the button "Absenden" (send settings). You will receive a confirmation window still in German.* With the next click e.g. on the CoDeSys logo or on any other dialog all texts should be displayed in your preferred board languageWe apologize the inconveniences! Thank you for your understanding!
