On page 21 of the documentation, it is written that the library has been tested with various processors (Bechoff BX 9000, Beckhoff CX 9001-1001, Wago 750-841, etc).  If I am using a CoDeSys PLC that is not listed, does it mean only that the library has not been tested on that PLC family or am I likely to run into many problems?     Thank you and kind regards! 

the list of tested hardware is simply the hardware we use in our labs for tests.any hardware not listed should work properly as long as it complies to the IEC61131-3 standard.since your hardware is using the Codesys 2 development system everything shopuld work easily and straight forewardmost users of OSCAT have Harware which is not listed in our manual.
