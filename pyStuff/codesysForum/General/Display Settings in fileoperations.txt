Hi Everybody

                      In Codesys programming I am creating a ".txt" file. I am using "Sysfilestreamfopen" function for this purpose. Is it possible to add colour affects like displaying the text in colour, Filling a selected portion with colour etc, in the file which is the output from the "Sysfilestreamfopen" operation.
Let me know if this can be possible through programming in Codesys. 


 Hoping earliest reply

I believe the coloring will be more of a function of the program you use to open it up later on.  When someone views the file, what software will they be using?   Notepad? Word? etc...

You will most likely need to add some sort of codes to the file to indicate color.  You might try to create an html or rtf file to include formatting information.
