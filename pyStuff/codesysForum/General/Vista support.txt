Does CoDeSys support Ms Vista? What are the plans for this new OS?

Even if there is no official release of CoDeSys 2.3 for Windows Vista in general you should already be able to work with it.

During installation it is necessary to execute CoDeSys installation routine als administrator, otherwise the setup will not be properly executed. I did not test it myself, but I was told that during the installation procedure there is an option which is configured by "using the right mouse click".
After a proper installation you can work as usually.

We have made tests with the SoftPLC PLCWinNT and a WAGO controller and both were successful. We have put the Vista release on our development schedule, thus there should be an official release soon.

On the other hand both the SoftPLC CoDeSys SP RTE and the CoDeSys ENI server which are realized as Windows Services can not yet be executed under Vista. But of course we have scheduled them as well for an adaptation.

CoDeSys 3.0 is not yet ready for Windows Vista. Theoretically you could work with it, but we can not recommend it so far. But of course this topic is on our road map, too.

Does the latest version of CoDeSys V2.3 support MS Vista now?

Vista is supported, but with some restrictions.
