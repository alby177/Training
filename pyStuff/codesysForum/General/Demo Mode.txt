 I have a software version supplied by Wago, and have downloaded the latest Build from the WEB. 

When I installed this version I notice that the Licence is Demo. Will this still allow me the same functions as my Wago version?

Thanks

Hello,
the CoDeSys developement is always a full version, even if you download it from the demo section.
The demo is only shown, if you start products which require licensing, like HMI, PlcWinNT, PLCRTE and so on. These products are limited in demo mode.
If you download the latest version of CoDeSys and select the Wago target file, you have a full version of the development system.

Best regards,

Manfred Werner
