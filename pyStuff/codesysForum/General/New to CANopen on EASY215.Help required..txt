I have to configure EASY215 as CANopen master. How can I do that with CoDeSys ? A sample program will be a great help.
Thanks in advance.

I had some progress. Options appearing in the PLC configuration-->CAN communication are only Base Parameters and Can Parameters.Now how do you map the PDOs ... where is the option available.
Thanks.

Parameters can be mapped using the parameter manager. Look under Help.

Thanks for the reply but EASY215 from frenzel berg does not give the option Parameter Manager,I only have two options(for master) 'Base Parameters' and 'Can Parameters' ,and it's the same for slave also(screenshot attached).
Please tell me where to find the options for PDO/SDO mapping.

I have not seen this before. I don't think I can be of any help. I believe you need manufacturer specific help on this topic.

The problem is solved when you paste the eds of EASY215 in a folder plcconf(if it doesn't exist then create it) in C:\Program Files\3S Software\CoDeSys V2.3\Library.
Also not all devices support options like 'Parameter Manager' and EASY215 is among them.

For your knowledge there is a configuration setup under PROJECT-OPTIONS-DIRECTORY where you can point to other than default locations for files. Glad to hear it's solved.
