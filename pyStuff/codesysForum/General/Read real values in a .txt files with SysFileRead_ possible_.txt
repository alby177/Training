Hello,I try to read "Real values" from a .txt files (~5000 parameters), directly on the Flash card of my Rexroth PLC. I can open it with SysFileOpen and I can read value from it with SysFileRead but, i received information in Byte... So in place to have 20 different positions, I have data in Byte, so maybe an array of 100 bytes...Is it possible to read directly the different real positions and store it in a array of real?Thank you for your help,Bests regards,Fred

what about STRING_TO_REAL

Hello,In fact, the SysFileRead, take the byte value of every digit. For example in .csv file: the value to read is -0,013, first line. I will have finally in my "buffer": byBuffer[0]= 45 // '-'byBuffer[1]= 48 // '0'byBuffer[2]= 44 // ','byBuffer[3]= 48 // '0'byBuffer[4]= 49 // '1'byBuffer[5]= 51 // '3'and then '$R' and '$N' for Return and New line. After I transform the byte in ascii with a IL_Byte_to_Ascii (something like that, I don't remember the right name). Present in Library of codesys.strBuffer[0]= '-'strBuffer[1]= '0'strBuffer[2]= ','strBuffer[3]= '0'strBuffer[4]= '1'strBuffer[5]= '3'strBuffer[6]= '$R'strBuffer[7]= '$N'Then you use a CONCAT for several digit (used '$R' and '$N' to stop concat). In the end you have a string with the value '-0,013'. You can use now the conversion string_to_real in order to have the real value.PAY ATTENTION that with a ',' (comma) the conversion string_to_real will not work, you MUST have '.' (point).'-0.013' will give -0.013 in the real value.Until now I didn't find something faster to read a real in a . csv or .txt...Regards,

the comma and the dot are language dependent, i would follow the english version, easier as you can not change the comma in a CDF.have a look into the oscat library.

You can also try this.A real number has 32bits in Codesys. So you can try the following:1. Read your real number, using SysFileRead, into a variable declared in the memory (eg. %MD8200), in double word (DWORD) format.2. Declare a real variable at the same marker address (eg. %MD8200) and you have got your real number.Example:BufferDWord AT %MD8200:DWORD;BufferReal    AT %MD8200:REAL;BufferDWord=SysFileRead(...);YourRealNumber=BufferReal;Regards,Lucian
