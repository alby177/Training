Hello everybody,

I have a question about the forcing of variables.

I Have a project that is written in CFC. The inputs to the system are CANopen I/O. If i go online and force an input it looks forced but it seems like the PLC is overwriting it the next cycle 
If i try to force an output on a CANopen node it also gets overwritten the next cycle. I can force it by putting the PLC in stop... and the force the output 

Is it not possible to force I/O???

I do it other way.
and no you can not force in puts and outputs direct only internal memory points.
In simulation it is no problem but in real time online it is impossible as it should.

For this purpose you can use an OR/AND port on the inputs.

I work a lot with alarms and i have a switch in software to look at the input or on the forced points 

SEL (simulation, input,off,on)
this works same for analog inputs.
for outputs i do same
SEL(forcing,normal,off,on)

They are in seperate POU so i can see what happens and i can change them easily without searching all POU's.
