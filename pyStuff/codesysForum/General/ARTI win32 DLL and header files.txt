Ought to be a simple question... where can I find the ARTI win32 DLLs and header files? The 3s-software website barely responds to a search on ARTI, the integration documents mention their existence, but no sign of them in the downloads or after installing the gateway.

please contact the 3S sales team for an offer for the PLCHandler
