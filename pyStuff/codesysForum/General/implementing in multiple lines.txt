I have long lines of code. In matlab I can just type "..." and the code follow in the next line, like:a = 90;b = 23;c = max(...    a,...    b);Do you know if in Structure text in Codesys there is a similar function to "..." ?

Hi,no, even not CODESYS V2.3 nor CODESYS V3 both open intellisense on unsing ".."BREdwin

You don’t need the dot dot. Just put on next line and indent if you like (you should but not required):Code:a = 90;b = 23;c = max(         a,         b);Or Code:a := 90;b := 23;c := max(         a,         b);I do this a lot for function block calls that have a lot of var ins and outs and IF statements with multiple ANDs and ORs.
