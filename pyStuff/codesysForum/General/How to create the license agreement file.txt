I have created a library with license formaet, but I don't know how to create license agreement to authorize other customer to use the library.

Hi

Library licensing is limited to OEM’s or important customers because it’s an additional effort for us.
We’ll create a tool which enables creating licenses for libraries with a specific vendor ID.
A licensable library appears in the licensing manager after it was inserted into a project once.
Please contact our sales department in concrete cases.

Bye, Frank
