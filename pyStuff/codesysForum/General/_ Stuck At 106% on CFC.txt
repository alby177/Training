Codesys 2.3.9.34(ABB) & Codesys 2.3.9.35(Wago) when in CFC the _ level is stuck at 106%.If I try changing the _ level the code is jumbled up on the screen and the display reverts to 106%.This bug started with the ABB version and I tried overinstalling the Wago version hoping it would fix the problem.I have tried uninstalling, but no use.I presume there is a registry entry or hidden file somewhere that is not deleted on uninstall.Does anyone know how to resolve this?

What's the "_ level"? Can you give a screenshot?

Hmm,  when I enter "_" the system seems to translate it to "_"."_ level"'Z''oom

this time I will try spelling it with more 'o's and see if it translates."_ level"

something is up with this system, it doesn't like _.I'll try spelling it 'z' 'o' 'o' 'm'  ans see if it replaces it with a '_'.

yes known problem, but not seen action from office yet.

Do you know what the Registry entrys are for Coesys or hidden files that this is held in??I have a number of PCs with Codesys installed and only one is suffering this bug - so it must be in a setting somewhere that is not removed when the program is uninstalled.I want to delete EVERY file that is associated with Codesys and try again.Thanks for your help.

If you change the font of the project you will be able to _:Project -> Options -> Editor -> FontWe use using Courier New 9 ptI am not sure (have not checked) what other fonts will work.I know Courier does not allow scaling.

Thanks for that - I never would have thought to try that.Works for Times New Roman as well.Looks like it works for true type fonts.Cheers
