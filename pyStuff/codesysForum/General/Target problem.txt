Hi, I got the program. When I want to open, target returns an error. Program was written by another programmer.I do not have problems making himself write.best regardsFatmir

you will have to find the target file and put the hardware configuration to it. (however you can load and edit the program without it. it defines where the I/O is.the libs , some are open, and free available, some will have to be bought.just google them and you will find several on the codesys site.
