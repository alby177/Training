Hi,
    I'm trying to read the DDE in excel via the gateway app.

I have it working in codesys and I've edited the line to change it from codesys to gatewayddeserver. 

I make my program a boot file and shutdown codesys. I open gatewaydde.exe and go online. set the PLC to run and open the spreadsheet.

This where everything goes south. I get pop asking to open gatewayd.exe and after clicking yes I get an error message saying the program is missing or damaged.

I've gone through all the help files and can not see what is wrong all the comms parameters are the same.

Just to let anyone know what the solution was. I did not have access to the C:\windows\gateway files. Codesys was unable to copy the symbol files to this folder so when GATEWAYDDESERVER had no symbol files in which to load.

Go the IT department grant me access and all working well.
