Hello,

I am currently using SysLibSockets library to develop
a client socket program for our Wago 758-870 PLC having  firmware 2.4.31/0107.


I have tried the following experiments to catch socket error but in vain.

1. Using SysSockGetLastError function and SysLibSocketsAsync  library functions. 
Access violation occurs 

2. Using SysSockGetOption .
 It always saves "0" in the variable supplied indicating no error, even when i have simulated an error. 

Please advice as to how I can get the last socket error.
