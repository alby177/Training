Hallo everybody,
Can I set a communication parameter , I mean baud rate and so
and can Using a modem connection to go on line in remote way  ?
thank you

Hello.

generally the communication settings are done

--> Online--> Communication Parameters
select New and chose Serial(Modem)
Chancheing the values for e.g. Initialize modem is done by a double-click to the value and typing in a new one. Changeing the Port, Baudrate,.. is done by simply double-click to the value once on each following double-click the value is changed.  

The folowing link from Wago describes a connection via modem.

Last but not least I attached a 3s dokument for using a modem (but sorry it's written in german)

I hope that helps
Ralph
