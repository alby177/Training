But I can not get how I will go forward. Initially i want create a small external library for C. then I want to use them as function block library in Codesys SP RTE.I have found a manual from 3S " Creating and linking External C library Fuctions" Document V 1.0. But it is little bit difficult for me as I never create any libray for C.I have follow this munual but i cant create actually.I hope,many of you may have experience to create libray for C code. It will be very helpful to tell me how to create externel libray for C.Thanks,Asif
