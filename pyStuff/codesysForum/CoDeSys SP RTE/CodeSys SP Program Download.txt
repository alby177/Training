Hi friends,I'm trying to simulate OPC server via PLCWinNT, but i could not download my program to PLCWinNT.Above you can find screenshot. PLCWinNT warns me "about no program loaded"Could you please help me to run PLCWinNT?

Hello My question may seem IDOT, but have you set the communication parameters before running the transfer program ?Online menu -> Communication Parameters. Click on "New" button, bring it a name and choose TCP/IP. IP address can be Localhost or your real IP address.You must also check the box "Download Symbol File" in the "General" tab of "SP PLCWinNT" configuration, is checked. 

Hi Japib,I've checked my communication parameters and everything seems ok, but i still can't download the program to SP PLCWinNT. For more details i add 2 screenshots.When i click login, after a few seconds later always it returns me with an error. Below you can see:Do you have any idea, why i am no succeeded in to use SP PLCWinNT?

It appears that you have a problem of communication configuration.Did you have a communication parameters like this : (value can be Localhost or your IP address)Attachment:Com params.jpgDid you ping your IP address ? Is it answers ?For now I have no other ideas 

Hello JAPIB,Thanks for your help, on communication parameters section, i've deleted all interfaces and defined a new localhost interface. Now it works properley.
