Hi,What is the SOFT PLC?What is the different between PLC and Soft PLC?Regards,hcchin

Hello, A PLC is specific hardware as Moeller, Wago, ABB, ...A Soft PLC is a program that runs on a computer.When you install CoDeSys V2, a Soft PLC called "CoDeSys SP PLCWinNT" is installed too. Best regards.

Hi, Do you means we can use the "CoDeSys SP PLCWinNT" as a PLC Controller on our PC?So We can make use our PC/Laptop to communicate/control with remote I/O?(provided if we have the protocol master card is installed on it, like profibus, deviceNet and CanOpen)Regards,hcchin

HelloYes of course you can use a PC as a PLC !Generally we use an industrial PC rather than a laptop.With communication boards, networks and input-output decentralized stations.You can use : Profibus, CANopen, Modbus RTU, Modbus TCP, ....But you should know two things : 1°) there are two soft PLC : CoDeSys PLC WintNT is dependent on Windows and CoDeSys SP RTE is not dependant on Windows.2°) These are not free soft PLC. You need a licence to use. Without licence they operate in demo mode during two hours, and after they should be re-started Best regards.

I want to use and IPC(Industrial PC) as PLC. OS may be any coomecially available. I want to buy CoDeSys RT to work with Windows OS.Where to buy and how to Buy?

a soft PLC same as a PLC can have multitasks in one program.i prefer to have one program with 4 tasks, so the overview is better.
