How can RTE communicate with SQL? Example?

Hello
There is an easy way to communicat directly between a control and a SQL-database.
With the driver SQL4automation (small Windows application) you can write and read data directly from and to a database with SQL-syntax in the control.
You need only a ethernet interface on the control and a windows platform in your network for running the application SQL4automation.
