Hi,
I have make the bootproject and set the auto-start and run of the boot project after boot the PC.
The RTservice always starts but the boot project sometimes doesn't start and i have to click to "Reset" and after click "start cycle" and so the program starts correctly.
when the program doesn't start i open codesys and when i do the login a message error appear "task violation in <main>". After the procedure "Reset and Run" the program starts correctly.
What does mean the error  "task violation"??

Another question:
I need to launch and run after codesys project a visual basic project.exe:
Is possible to launch by codesys an external program for example ".exe" of visual basic??

Sorry for bad english,
Regards
Stefano

Yes,It is possible to launch an "exe" via codesys program.For example attached file showsn command which launches "lrae" binary in linux.Regards,Winy
