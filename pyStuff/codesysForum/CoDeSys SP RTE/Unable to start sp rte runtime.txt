Hi everybody This is my first post and I was wandering if someone could help me..I had a codesys v2.3. Application that was running properly but last time I started my application..the runtime sp rte haven't started....I try ed to run it manually but without result..Into the runtime property I read Kernel not loadedThread not started.How can I fix this problem?Thanks in advice.

Hi,if the SP RTE has already worked on this pc (without changing the OS or hardware)I would recommend to delete the Bootproject (DEFAULT.prg and DEFAULT.chk) in the RTE directory.BREdwin
