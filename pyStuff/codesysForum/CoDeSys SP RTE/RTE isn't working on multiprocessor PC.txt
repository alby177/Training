I have a PC with 2 processors, but RTE fail when I try to start it. Isn't pc with to processors supported in CoDeSys SP RTE? If not, will it be supported in the feature?

RTE does not support mutliple processor architectures under V2.x.  I was told that the RTE will add this capability starting with V3.1 in first half of 2007.

You can always shut down one processor for testing.

- click on Start -> Run...
- type msconfig.exe and press return
- go to tab BOOT.INI
- click on Advanced options...
- activate /NUMPROC=
- select 1
- confirm all dialogs with OK
- reboot the computer
