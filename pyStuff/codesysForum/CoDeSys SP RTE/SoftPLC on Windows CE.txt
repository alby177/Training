Hi,I am evaluating the 3S Codesys SP RTE platform on Windows CE (ARM based). I have a few questions regarding the stability on Windows.In some documents it is mentioned that on Windows XP the SoftPLC is able to continue execution even when Windows XP has crashed.  1. How is this functionality achieved? 2. Is hardware IO (serial, CAN, etc.) completely handled by the SoftPLC (i.e. independent from Windows) ?3. Is there documentation available on the architecture of the CodeSys SP RTE?4. Is robustness against Windows crashes also guaranteed under Windows CE?5. What happens when Windows has crashed and the PLC program executes Windows dependent functions (i.e. file IO)?Regards,Dinne Bosman
