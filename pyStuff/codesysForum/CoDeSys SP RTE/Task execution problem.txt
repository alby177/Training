Hello,
i have this critical problem with an automatic machine controlled by Codesys SP RTE for winXp. 
my application have 5 task, the application goes correctly in "running" state, but after a random time the automatic machine is freezed, in the configuration task the task are all in RUN but the counter cycle of every task is stop and all tasks should be stop...at this point the only solution is to restart the pc  

Why the tasks don't run?
Other best solution??

Best Regards
Stefano

Hello,
please post your application

Also check your cycle times. Are you doing any long processing tasks? Maybe the watchdog timer is tripping? Put a counter in each task and see if they are all being executed. Try disabling the application one task at a time and determine if there is something in one of the tasks that is causing an error. Try to isolate it.

put the tasktime slower of a task not needed badly.check for overflow in a counterlook for exits in a program, better is return. (they will leave the stack)
