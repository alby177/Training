I have found a similar topic but that wasn`t helpful and more than a year old.Is it possible to run Codesys on Orange Pi at today`s date? If yes, what can and what cannot (interfaces, GPIO etc...) be controlled?I have tested the Codesys V3 on Raspberry PI and I was wondering what are the differences with the Orange PI, is this the kernel modules for hardware dependence?Thank you to everyone for reading and answering to this topic.

Hi,no no this is not possible at the moment and even not planned.BREdwin
