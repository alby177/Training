Hi,Presently working with BeagleBoneBlack, trying with BBB with EK1100+EL2809+EL6080. Could you please clarify the following....1. My application is not getting started when power on the BBB.(Still I have not Activated lenience)2. I am not able to map EL6080 for retentive variables.3. Do we need to have proper shutdown of BBB or we can plug out the power(5V). Any feedback Data Corruption.Regards,Kumar Eswaran
