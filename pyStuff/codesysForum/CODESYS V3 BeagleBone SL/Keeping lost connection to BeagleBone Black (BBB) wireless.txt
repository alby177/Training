Hi,I installed free codesys 3.5 sp12 patch3+ (64bit) and beaglebone black wireless (running with bone-debian 9.3 lxqt) then update BBB from codesys. Installed the package v3.5.12.30.But always can not detect the target with IP Address.( Tried with USB and Wifi)Anyway I can get the status as below:root@beaglebone:~# service codesyscontrol status● codesyscontrol.service - LSB: Prepares and starts codesyscontrol   Loaded: loaded (/etc/init.d/codesyscontrol; generated; vendor preset: enabled)   Active: active (exited) since Sat 2018-05-05 23:31:16 UTC; 7min ago     Docs: man:systemd-sysv-generator(8)  Process: 7753 ExecStop=/etc/init.d/codesyscontrol stop (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS)  Process: 7794 ExecStart=/etc/init.d/codesyscontrol start (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS)May 05 23:31:14 beaglebone systemd[1]: Starting LSB: Prepares and starts codesyscontrol...May 05 23:31:14 beaglebone codesyscontrol[7794]: Backup licensesMay 05 23:31:14 beaglebone codesyscontrol[7794]: tar: Removing leading `/' from member namesMay 05 23:31:15 beaglebone codesyscontrol[7794]: chmod: cannot access '/sys/bus/i2c/devices/0-0050/at24-0/nvmem': No such file or directoryMay 05 23:31:15 beaglebone codesyscontrol[7794]: pid 7813's current affinity mask: 1May 05 23:31:15 beaglebone codesyscontrol[7794]: pid 7813's new affinity mask: 1May 05 23:31:16 beaglebone codesyscontrol[7794]: codesyscontrol startedMay 05 23:31:16 beaglebone systemd[1]: Started LSB: Prepares and starts codesyscontrol.After "Stop" then "Start" the runtime in "beaglebone black" tab.

And the dialog "No connection to the device. Please rescan your network" pop out. The scan network will not work except I do the routine "stop" then "start" again. But it only last for few minutes.Above situation tested with both USB and WiFi connection. I will try this on the second BBB later to exclude the hardware problem.Thanks!Chen

The 2nd BBB wireless has same behavier.   Is BBB wireless not supported by codesys at all?Just found other topic https://forum.codesys.com/viewtopic.php?f=26&t=8766And two years beforehttps://forum.codesys.com/viewtopic.php?f=26&t=7471
