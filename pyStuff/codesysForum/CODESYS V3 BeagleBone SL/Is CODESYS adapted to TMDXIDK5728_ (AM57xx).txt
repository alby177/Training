Hi,t looks like CODESYS when i watch the video of the link below.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAiKjZhZW8sIs CODESYS adapted to TMDXIDK5728? (AM57xx)I want to know how to experience programming in the same environment. Is there a SL for TMDXIDK5728?If you do not have that product, do you any plan to release it?Thanks.

Yes this is codesys. It will be the same as using the raspberry pi or beagle bone black by the looks of things. For more info I would contact the manufacturer of the device. (Texas instruments by the look of things). Codesys is just the programming environment. Sent from my SM-N9005 using Tapatalk
