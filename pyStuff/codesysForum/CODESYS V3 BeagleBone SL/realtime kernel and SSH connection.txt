Hello,I did kernel update as described by Edwin viewtopic.php?f=26&t=5652&start=30#p15463I have tried kernel 4.4.14-bone-rt-r11, tried 4.9.13-bone-rt-r4https://www.rcn-ee.com/deb/jessie-armhf/also tried 4.4.52-ti-rt-r91https://github.com/beagleboard/linux/co ... ertCNelsonEvery time when I update to RT kernel I loose SSH access to BBB. In case of problem with SSH, BBB FAQ says:Delete the file called "dropbear_rsa_host_key" in the location of /etc/dropbear/.Then you need run the command '/etc/init.d/dropbear start'. After update to RT kernel directory /etc/dropbear/ does not exist and no command /etc/init.d/dropbearAny suggestions how to activate SSH?Thanks

Hello,I have the sampe problem. Have you solved it?

In Putty choose "Serial" instead of SSH, change COM1 to COM3, leave speed at 9600. Open connection and login as root. If invitation doesn't come left-click inside putty window on the cursor and wait 15-30sec. If doesn't work, connect monitor, keyboard, mouse to beaglebone and do steps below in terminal. Open terminal and login as root.First try to regenerate host keys:Code:rm /etc/ssh/ssh_host_*dpkg-reconfigure openssh-serverIf doesn't help, delete keys,Code:rm /etc/ssh/ssh_host_*Reinstall SSH server. Beaglebone has to see Internet, connect Ethernet cable.Code:apt-get install openssh-serverIf doesn't work, regenerate keys again:Code:rm /etc/ssh/ssh_host_*dpkg-reconfigure openssh-serverIn my case I have got SSH working. In your case please post the result in this thread.https://wiki.debian.org/SSH
