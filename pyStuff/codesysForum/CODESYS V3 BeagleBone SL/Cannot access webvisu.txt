What could be the problem? BBB is connected to internet an I can ping 8.8.8.8 and I am trying to connect 192.168.7.2:9090/webvisu.htmBest Regards

Hi,you need to callhttp://8.8.8.8:9090/webvisu.htmand add a port forwarding (in your router) from 8.8.8.8 to 192.168.7.2 , did you add this ?Is 192.168.7.2 (the real eth0 Interface on bbb? or USB connected interface)BREdwin
