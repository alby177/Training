Greetings,I would like to use BeagleBone Black with CoDeSys communicating by CANopen with other devices. In the document First steps, you describe how to use CAN with CAN/serial cape. IsnÂ´t it possible to use the CAN interface on BBB or do I need the cape for it to work? The only e-shop in my country that offers CAN cape for BBB will have it in like 6 weeks... Best regardsFilip Stec
