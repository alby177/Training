Dear Edwin,Is it possible to leverage the rela time capabilities of Xenomai for codesys on a beagle bone?BR,Carsten

Hi,why not using rt_preemt patched kernel instead of using xenomai?BREdwin

Hi Edwin,Thanks for the suggestion. To my knowledge though Xenomai is more hard RT than rt_preempt, isn't it?Could you therefor answer on my previous question if Xenomai can be used in user and or kernel mode?BR,Carsten

Hi,yes it is right, but from my experiance there are not many applications out there which reallynot could deal with rt_preemt patched kernel and really need Xenomai.For this runtime release from store it is not possible to use with Xenomai.BREdwin

Hi Edwin,Thanks for your quick response. Will the runtime be suitable for use with Xenomai in future releases?BR,Carsten

Hello,At the moment not planned.BREdwin

Hi Edwin,Is it possible to create a xenomai 3 capable codesys in one of the future releases? With the current rt_preempt I get around 70-80 us jitter under load.I am using the setup with a BBB industrial with a task cycle time of 1ms. The current jitter results in 'unpleasant' behaviour in our haptic setup.BR,Carsten Voort

Hi Carsten,still not planned at the moment.BREdwin
