Getting started question:Is there any sample project or tutorial published specifically for BBB. I am looking for a very simple GPIO example showing how to assign available IO to variables. I thought there was something in the store but seemed to be removed?

I found it. There is a sample installed with the package in ...[user dir]\CODESYS Control for BeagleBone SL\3.5.9.0\Examples\GPIO BeagleBone.project"However after loading this example and updating I found a lot of errors (600+). It appeared most were from missing Raspberry Pi libs (am I the only one starting from BBB right away without Pi?   )Now's just 4 left, all related to Filereader:   ------ Build started: Application: CODESYS_Control_for_BeagleBone_Black.Application -------                typify code ...[ERROR]         iodrvgpio, 1.0.1.10 (3s - smart software solutions gmbh): DetermineProcessorType [GPIO](Line 5 (Decl)): C0077:  Unknown type: 'FileReader'[ERROR]         iodrvgpio, 1.0.1.10 (3s - smart software solutions gmbh): DetermineProcessorType [GPIO](Line 3, Column 1 (Impl)): C0035:  Program name, function or function block instance expected instead of 'fr'[ERROR]         iodrvgpio, 1.0.1.10 (3s - smart software solutions gmbh): DetermineProcessorType [GPIO](Line 4, Column 1 (Impl)): C0035:  Program name, function or function block instance expected instead of 'fr.GetLine'[ERROR]         iodrvgpio, 1.0.1.10 (3s - smart software solutions gmbh): DetermineProcessorType [GPIO](Line 4, Column 1 (Impl)): C0077:  Unknown type: 'FileReader'                Compile complete -- 4 errors, 5 warningsAny hints?leo

Hi,seems that this example somehow is not the latest version.1. New Project and select BBB device2. Plug Device GPIO's3. add mappingBREdwin

Thanks for the help Edwin, this works.Also I wasn't aware of the "plug device..." option, the new BBB project comes with an empty mappingLeo
