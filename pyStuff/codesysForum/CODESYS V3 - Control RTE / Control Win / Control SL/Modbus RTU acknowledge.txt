HelloI'm using the IoDrvModbus v3.5.1.0 library.I'm using cyclic and triggered channels.I have some questions for people who may have used it before:1. When the channel is 'Rising-Edge triggered', is this actually rising edge, OR does it read/write for as long as the trigger bit is high? (level triggered)2. If I trigger a channel, is there any feedback to tell me that it has 'gone'? I seem to have to hold the trigger bits high for a time (which I don't like)3. Is there any guidance for how many triggers can go on at the same time (ie if my code wants to trigger two channels at the same time)Thanks for your helpph0010421
