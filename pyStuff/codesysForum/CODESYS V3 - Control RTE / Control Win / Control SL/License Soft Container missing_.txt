Hello,I have control win SL running on a windows 7 VM. Quite a while ago, I upgraded the runtime. After that, the license is missing. I'm also not even seeing the "softcontainer" where it was previously installed.How do I reinstall the missing softcontainer? How do I reinstall the license and do I have to deal with this any time I do a runtime update???

Hi,this does only happen if you change virual machine settings (add core / add networkcard for example) an udate ofthe runtime does not change anything on the license!To prevent this (no lost license on vm settings change) it might be more suiable to use a runtime key on virtual machines:https://store.codesys.com/accessories/c ... mpakt.htmlInstall the license on this runtime key (Atteention: this does only work if you are not using a Windows Server where the runtime is running)We use: https://www.eltima.com/de/purchase/usb- ... et/?os=win to serve the USB to the virtual Environment.Wibu has recommend:(not the complete List)1. Belkin Network USB-Hub „Belkin F5L009ea" (<http://www.belkin.com/networkusbhub/> )2. SEH Computertechnik GmbH  „myUTN-80 USB Dongleserver" (<http://www.myutn.de/myutn-produkte/myutn-80dongleserver.html> )3. W&T Interfaces „USB-Server Industry Typ #53641" (<http://www.wut.de/e-53641-ww-dade-000.php> )BREdwin
