Hello, our team want to create a control runtime for our device based o Linux.  if I understand correctly, first need to download the CODESYS Control Runtime Toolkit and then i can get manual how to make control runtime for our platform. It is necessary to assess the complexity of programming and understanding of the general principles of creating custom control runtime.1) I understand it right? or do I need to turn to a third party company for help and  pay for the development?2) on the Web site says " A trial version of the SoftPLC under Windows is part of the standard setup of the CODESYS Development System" . A download Codesys V3 and fully installed it, but I have not found Runtime Toolkit. Where i can get it?Thanks
