I want to create a UDP listener that is non-blocking.To do so I use SysSockSelect function. The problem is that the value diReady (Number of sockets that are ready for IO) never becomes 1.The code I have is:tvTimeout.tv_sec:= 0;tvTimeout.tv_usec:= 0;fdRead.fd_count:= 1;fdRead.fd_array[0]:= hListenSocket;Socket_Result := NBS.SysSockSelect(NBS.SOCKET_FD_SETSIZE, ADR(fdRead), 0, 0, ADR(tvTimeout), ADR(diReady));I am sure data is ready for IO because when I call the function SysSockRecv data is read.The same code I use in CoDeSys v2.3 and there it works.Does anyone know why this doesn't work in v3.5 SP10?Thanks,Richard

Hi Richard,I would recommend to use this project from that forum post based on netbase services:viewtopic.php?f=21&t=6625&hilit=UDP+raspberry#p13743BREdwin

Hi Edwin,Function block UDP_Receive is also blocking.But I have used UDP_Receive in a separate task so now it doesn't matter that is it blocking.Thanks,Richard
