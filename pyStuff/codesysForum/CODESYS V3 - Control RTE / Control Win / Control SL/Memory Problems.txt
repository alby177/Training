Hi There,I am working with Codesys 3.5.10 SP2 and I am having some issues with the memory on my Industrial PC/////CPU: on-board Intel® Celeron® Quad Core processor J1900 processor,up to 2.42GHz, 2M L2 cache BIOS: AMI BIOS System memory: 2 x 204-pin DDR3L SO-DIMM socket, 4GB DDR3L(default), support up to 8GB DDR3L-1066/1333, non-ECC andun-buffered Storage device:1 x external locked CFast socket1 x hard drive bay: optional 1 x 2.5" SATA HDD or 1 x SATA DOMGood enough right, ok but here are the messages that I get from 3.5and 2.3, same program with same PLC.In Codesys 2.3 as you see, there is no problems only on 3.5;Please can someone tell me what could be the problem?This is a huge program that I have written that contains more than 18 structures, 18 FB's, 25 Functions, 4 PLC_PRG's, thanks in advance for your help!

Hello,guess the main question is missing you probably are asking for how to save retain/persistent data on this system, ist that right?for using retain memory you need to have an UPS on your industrial pc or additional hardware (non volatile ram – NVRAM)This is needed for CODESYS V2.3 and CODESYS V3.For using retains a proper shutdown of the plc/pc is needed (the plc runtime does save the retain/persistent variables on this shutdown to the retain file and restore them on next bootup)This is the way it works (V2.3 RTE and Version 3 Control RTE)If you have additional hardware in your PC NVRAM – then this proper shutdown of windows is not needed you could only which off because the retains are written cyclic.That is the whole story for the retains. Some industrial pc manufacturer provide a NVRAM (pci express I guess) card to do this in CODESYS Control RTE V3 as hardware add on (you need to ask your pc manufacturer if the have it for this pc)But not sure if this works in V2.3. For Control RTE V3 it is for sure possible.Now you need to decide:1.	Add a UPS to your system (maybe it is already there?)2.	Add NVRAM card to your systemSee the description how to use them here in the online help:https://help.codesys.com/webapp/cds-var ... n=3.5.11.0maybe the third option in combination with UPS, you could use the persistence manager from application composer.There is the description in the online help too for doing this.BREdwin
