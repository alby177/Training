Hello,I want to create a table with 16 columns. Then I will use 8 table with different contents. No in my opinion, I can use place holder and no need to create 8 table. I can create just one table then with placeholder I can use this table as different contents.I create an array like "iaExampleArray: ARRAY[1..8,1..16] OF INT". Then I declared 16 values for each table. Then created a table and in its "Textdisplay" menu I wrote "iaExampleArray[$NUM$,INDEX]".Now in any page when I call this table with NUM = 1 ,2,3 etc. values I defined will come to the table index. But I can not see NUM variable in placeholder menu. It is not accepting. What is wrong here? Or in table is there not a property like this?
