Hi,I have problems communicating with Siemens IM 151-3 PN v7.0 using Control Win 3.5.8.4.Can you tell me what the codes from "Station Status" means?Attached are pictures with Station Status and Diag Data.

Hello, I got the same issue but I don't know how to solve it?Did you have any solution or the something in order to fix this problem? Thanks in advance

Yes, you can try to increase the Send Clock and the Reduction Ratio.Hope this will help you.

Thanks for your reply.It works, but now I got some problem about the Siemens device. I don't have the file .xml of 6ES7-315-2FJ14-0AB0. I also created by Simatic Manager but it does not work. Error: The correct import filter for the file could be not detected.hope your help. thanks

I don't have Simatic Manager installed but I made a test using TIA Portal. I created an xml file for CPU315F-2 PN/DP + 1 DIx16 and it worked to import in Codesys. What version of Codesys are you using?

Hi,I am using PFC200 and Wago's Profinet modules (five of them). I had to slow down Send Clock ...I still have problem with loosing "Online" after downloading new version of application.It seems that CPU doesn't have enough time to handle two Ethernet.

Hi,yes I agree that PFC200 is from CPU performance limited to do profinet.In this case it is usually better to work for example with Ethercat and 350-354BREdwin
