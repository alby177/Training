Hi all,It is possible to download a file *.app directly in the PLC without the source code?I can not find a command/tool, I'm wondering what are they used for?

The files application_name.app and application_name.crc are the actual run code files. On controllers I am familiar with, I can copy these two files and a small text file with the text application_name in it and the control will reprogram itself after a power cycle (maybe this is only required if the application name changes...). But I don't think this is standard CoDeSys behavior for all device types like PC based devices.  You could try looking at your device file system and see if you can change these two files and get the updated operation on the next boot.

Thanks for the reply.Unfortunately I need to perform this operation on a CODESYS HMI Device.

Hi,if this a V3 HMI it is the same.copy Application.app / Application.crc to the /Plclogic/Applicaton directory and add the application name to the CODESYSCotnrol.cfg [CmpApp]..Application.1=Application..BREdwin

Ok thank you.It works
