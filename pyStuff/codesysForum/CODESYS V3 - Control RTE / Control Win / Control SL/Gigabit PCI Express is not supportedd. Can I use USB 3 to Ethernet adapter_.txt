HiI am running Codesys Control RTE on windows 10, PC is based on i7-7700 CPU.I purchased the TP-LINK TG-3468 ethernet adapter but Iv couldn't install the driver for Ethercat support. http://www.tp-link.com/us/products/deta ... -3468.htmlthe chipset is Realtek PCIe GBE Family Controller.When I Uninstall, the driver reinstalls automatically. When I disable automatic install of drivers, I can't see it in the device manager and when I click "scan for hardware changes" it installs the regular driver again. So I thought about buying the USB 3 - ethernet adapter. https://www.amazon.com/StarTech-Gigabit ... B0095EFXMCWill it work?

Hi,using usb is not supported on Control RTE - plug and play/hotconnet is not a real good option for realtime I would recommend to buy a networkadapter which has a proved chipset to work with Control RTE.Realtek 8139 (CmpRTL81x9Mpd)   Realtek RTL8139 (und kompatiblen) Ethernet-Contoller.   the 8100 und 8110 are compatible too.   Realtek 8169 (CmpRTL8169Mpd)   Realtek 8169/810  Realtek RTL8111B / RTL8111D / RTL8111E  Intel EtherExpressPro1000 (CmpEt1000Mpd )  82541,82547,82567,82571,82573,82574,82583V, i210, i217-LM etc  Intel EtherExpress PRO/100 (CmpEt100Drv)  Intel 82551,82557,82559  Intel 82559, 82558, 82557 and 82550  BREdwin

Ok, but how do I install the drivers in Windows 10?When I Uninstall the stock driver, the driver reinstalls automatically. When I disable automatic install of drivers, I can't see it in the device manager anymore and when I click "scan for hardware changes" it installs the regular driver again.

Hi,are you on 35SP12?here is basically the same procedure than in Windows 7:BREdwin

yes I am on 35SP12This is the adapter I bought:https://www.amazon.com/Intel-EXPI9301CT ... B001CXWWBEThe only way I found to install the Codesys driver is to uninstall the stock driver and then click on "add legacy hardware". I then browsed to the Codesys CmpEt1000Mpd folder, but now I have the error "This device is not working properly because Windows cannot load the drivers required for this device. (Code 31)" in the device manager.And there is a yellow warning sign near the device.and when I click on "scan for hardware changes" I see the computer installed the regular driver (Intel Gigabit CT desktop adapter)here:

OK I managed to install the driver finally... only with group policy editor.Now when I declare a softmotion project, everything looks fine except for the task that was created for the ethertcat master device.the warning I have is "no POU defined for task - ethercat task"although I can run the program with no problems. I have another task for a regular application.Is this warning important?
