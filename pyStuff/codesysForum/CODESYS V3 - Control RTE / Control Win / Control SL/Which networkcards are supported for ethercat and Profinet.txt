Hi,yes should work, if not please let us know.BREdwin

I use the "Codesys Control Win V3" in the same PC with development and all running OK for:* profinet on VMWARE Intel Pro/1000 nic. When i try to run the same project in an Advantech PC with "Codesys Control Win V3" the Ethernet bus not work if i use the profinet.* profinet on Realtek PCIe GBE Family Controller.Attachment:WinPLC_adapter.pngWith profinet the Ethernet bus not work.Attachment:WinPLC_fault.pngAttachment:WinPLC_fault_02.pngWithout profinet the Ethernet bus work.Attachment:WinPLC_ok_01.pngAttachment:WinPLC_ok_02.pngI try to run in the Advantech PC with "Codesys Control RTE V3" but then i have hardware compatibility problems.Please help because i am in midle of project and ihave spend much of my time for tests.Regards

Hi,for Profinet you need to install a CODESYS network driver. (same which you need to ethercat)not sure if it does fit (you might check the hardware id's in windows device manager)I would give CmpRTL8169Mpd a tryBREdwin

Hi EdwinPlease give me instructions where to find the driver and how to use for:Codesys Control RTE and Codesys Control Win PLC.Regards

Hi,Control RTE:see the Control RTE user manual for the instructions on how to install the Windows driver...-> Windows DeviceManager networkdriver  you need to replace the existing Realtek to the CODESYS Realtek Driver then add it to CODESYSControl.cfgand after doing this a reboot is needed.Control Win:You need to install WPcap for using every networkdriver (manufacturer independent)BREdwin

Hi EdwinI try your instructions and work OK for Control WIN with default driver or with Codesys CmpRTL8169Mpd driver but with Control RTE works for a litle and after 1 to 10 seconds i take error exception:Attachment:Profinet_freeze.pngAny help?Another one tell me how to work the Serial Comms with Control RTE.Regards

Hi,yes this is a known bug which will be solved with 3.5SP8Patch1 (release is 18th February)If you need a.s.a.p a bugfix I could give a release Candidate for Patch1.... write to 3S Support.For serial communication I could send an Project example if needed. BREdwin

Hi EdwinPlease do something quick because i need tomorrow start the project tests at my costumer place.Until now i have do my tests with Raspberry run time but for the final project i need to work with Control RTE.Regards

Hi,I've sent you an email...BREdwin
