I am currently using CoDeSys V3.5 SP12 trying to grab drab some sensor data using a controller. Let me touch on the hardware architecture first.Computer -> LAN cable -> Conprosys controller -> RS-232 Serial cable -> CHINO temperature senor---I have seen guides on how to open serial com ports using "COM.Open" and such but they are focusing on Computer -> Serial -> Controller. In my case I am hoping to open the Controller SERIAL COM port. I searched for the data sheet and it indicated that the CoDeSys syntax for that controller serial com port being "PORT 1"Link to mentioned controller (CPS-PCS341MB-DS1-1201): https://www.contec.com/jp/download/cont ... 370d53120aSo how do I actually go about activating that Serial com port on the controller in CoDeSys?---Another issue being more of CoDeSys.When I add Devices in CoDeSys, which do I select for my LAN then Serial configuration?MODBUS_COM> MODBUS_SERIAL_DEVICEorMODBUS_COM> MODBUS_MASTER_COM_PORT> MODBUS_SLAVE_COM_PORTorEthernet> MODBUSTCP_SLAVE_DEVICE---This has been confusing me for quite some time now, have no background on CoDeSys. Appreciate any help and confirmation, thanks.

Hello,which plc are you using, is this  Control Win?I would recommend to the check this examples here:https://store.codesys.com/serial-com.html->install it via CODESYS shopping cart and open it then here'c:\Users\<YourWindowsUserName>\CODESYS Examples\SerialCom\1.0.0.1\SerialCom.project There are two applications in you need to decide which one is better for your needs (SyscomExample is more low Level based on the syslibs)If you see the project, there is nothing in the device tree according the Serial communcation... so for plain using the com portthis is not needed.If you use a higher level protocoll like modbus rtu, then you need to add a modbus serial com port.BREdwin
