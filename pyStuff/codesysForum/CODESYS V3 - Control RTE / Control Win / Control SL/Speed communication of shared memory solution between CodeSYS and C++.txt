Dear all,I would like to use Shared memory to exchange data between CodeSys and C++ app. However, I realized the speed of communication is very slow.Every 50ms, I write data from C++ to memory and Codesys read it, but Codesys missed data in some period cycle.Does anyone know how speed of this kind of exchange data using shared memory? Please help me, I would very appreciate and welcome your helps.Thank you,

Hi,we need more Information:On which plc are you doing this?This should work way faster.BREdwin

Hi Mr. Edwin Schwellinger,I use Codesys Control RTE SL which is in following link:https://store.codesys.com/codesys-contr ... __store=enAnyway, could you please let me know which is fastest way to exchange data between PLC and C++ applicaiton?Best regards,Mr. PHUC

Hi,yes ok should be way faster.... Are you using this example here?https://store.codesys.com/shared-memory ... tml#System RequirementsBREdwin

Can I use UDP to exchange data between C++ and PLC? What library should I use? I see that there are many library such as CAA net base, SysSocket,...Best regards,PHUC
