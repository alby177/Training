Hi I'm trying to select a CANopen miniPICe card to be used in a PC with CODESYS RTE and CANopen Master and I need a reference of supported hardware for his configuration.I can see there are two components  CmpSJACanDrv  and CmpHilscherCIFX than can be configured into de component manager of the RTE cgf file but I donâ€™t know which hardware is compatible with it.I guess the Hilscher CIFX 90E-CO\F can be driven with the  CmpHilscherCIFX componentI also guess the  PEAK PCAN-MiniPCIe IPEH-003048 can be driven with the CmpSJACanDrvIs there any reference or some one of you had used any of this cards or other brand cards like IXXAT with CODESYS RTE?Thanks

Hi,not really - check the RTE documentation  in generall only the SJA based cards are supported.Another Option if there is no Slot available in your pc -Ethercat CAN Gateway by EL6751.BREdwin
