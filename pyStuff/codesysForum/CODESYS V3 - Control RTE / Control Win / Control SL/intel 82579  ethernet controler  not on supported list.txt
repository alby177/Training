Edwin,Will "Intel® I210IT PCI-E Gigabit LAN" controller work for EtherCAT?Kumar.E

Edwin,can  not get it working. I have beckhoff TC2 installed  , so first  I removed  the Twincat Intel PCI ethernet adapter and  uninstalled TwinCat2restartthen the  intel 82579 comes  up as networkadapter and I removed  it.at first  could not find  the right inf file ,  but found  it  on reinstall date  in  oem 4.removed  oem4.inf and oem4.pnfrestartthen  it comes up with unindetified hardware and  i go to the driver location.but it  indicates that  no valid  driver for this hardware is found.i found the drivers in  windows /system32/drivers.  (CmpEt100drv.sys CmpEt1000Drv.sys)that is different from the  location that  is  in the documentation <RTE-installation directory>\cmpet1000 but are the right ones  i think.Had  to do  system recovery  at this  point because  ethernet was  not working  any more.can you help me to get  it working.it is a  XP sp3  windows  7 PC

Edwin works. thanks. the same  file was  already in the map . That one didn,t work.  Replaced it by the one you send and that worked.Need RTE for distributed clock  for the drives. The  drives otherwise go in error because  of the jitter  if i use codesys controlHad to remove beckhoff twincat 2 otherwise  it keeps installing the  twincat  intel DCI ethernet adapter.What happens  if  I reinstall beckhoff twincat  2 or 3. It overwrites the driver again  i think.not i good idea, but I need twincat also to set basis parameters for  the  ax drives an other beckhoff devices.Must use  2 pc,s one for codesys,  one for beckhoff . any tips?regardsHan

Hi Kumar.Eyes should work too.If the vendor id is not in the inf file add it an please let me knowBREdwin

Hi,check the Control RTE Manual.And since 3.5SP12 there is Control RTE and Control Win in the online help:https://help.codesys.com/webapp/_cds_rt ... n=3.5.12.0you need to add the component in the RTE configuration.That will solve itBREdwin

Edwin,Ok, it is working now.forgot the driver in the component manager.thankx
