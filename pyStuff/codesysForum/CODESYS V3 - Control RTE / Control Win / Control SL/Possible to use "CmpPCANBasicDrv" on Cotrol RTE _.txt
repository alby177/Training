It is possible to use "CmpPCANBasicDrv" on Cotrol RTE ? I add CmpPCANBasicDrv in config file.. then try to start RTE.. and have message on image in attachment?Or it is possible to using only in Control Win SL?

Hi,no this is not possible to use the USB CAN Peak,this must be a PCI/PCIExpress Interface for using with Control RTE.USB devices are only possible to use with Control Win (non realtime)BREdwin
