Hi all. I searched for this information in the manuals, FAQs and forum but I could not find an answer. I hope someone of you can help me.We use the Softmotion RTE with a standard application on production machines. For security reasons we need to add a different online user and password on each machine, in order to prevent unauthorized access to the soft PLC,  since the computer is usually network connected.This must be done by the production guys, so we don't want them to install the complete Codesys IDE and learn how to use the functions to do this simple task.So the question:  is possible to do this in an alternate way?I found that whenever I create the new online user,  Codesys creates two files,  .UserMgmtDB.csv and .UserMgmtRightDB.csv in the CODESYS Control RTE3 directory.In particular the online user name and encrypted password are stored in  .UserMgmtDB.csv  and infact I can take the system back to free access if I simply delete this file.In conclusion, the problem could be reduced to find a way to generate the csv file offline, so we can deliver it to the production team along with the actual application files.Thank you in advance for any adviceRegards
