Hi.I bought three licences for the raspberry pi.Per email i got the licence keys and wanted to add them in the engineering system to put them on the raspberrys.But i canÂ´t do this. I got an Internal Error 10114: "context could not be properly read (No FirmUpdateCounter found for firm code 101597)".The engineering system is a virtual machine with hyperV.Programming and Updating of the raspberry pi was no problem.The first problem occured by installing the licences.I found no info about this error.What's the reason for this?Thanks!

I've contacted Bug Support and have an open ticket for the same issue. Have you been able to solve your issue? I will gladly update if/when I find the fix.

I was able to install the licenses directly to device instead of the License Manager method. Edit Licenses... option is available in PLC Settings of Device. Hope this helps.
