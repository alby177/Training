Hi,I am trying to integrate UPBoard(www.up-board.org) installed with Windows IoT Enterprises +Codesys RTE.PLC is not starting.Please share your experience.Regards,Kumar.E

Hi,never tried (have no board available to test it)you need to check:1. Does it have bios settings like ipc's if yes:disable speedstep c-states etc all Features which have influence on the cpu core speed ( RTE need a stable CPU core clock speed to be hard realtime capable)2. on 64bit - to deactivate hyperthreading is mandatoryBREdwin

Edwin,i am not sure, I assume as follows...while we disable the hyperthreading, the processor will work as singe core. using the quad core motherboard is as googd as using single corePlease confirm..Kumar.E

Hi,which processor is build in in this board (they offer several boards I could not really see which is yours)BREdwin

Edwin,Processor used in this board ..Intel® Celeron™ N3350 (up to 2.4 GHz)Intel® Pentium™ N4200 (up to 2.5 GHz)Intel® Atom ™ E3940 (up to 1.8Ghz )LAN ..2x Gb Ethernet (full speed, Realtek 8111G) RJ-45

Hi,from my point of view this should work on all these 3 boards.How could we check them?Could we get hardware or by remote session?BREdwin
