I want to know if Codesys supports ARM Cortex A8 (AM 3354) with Linux.Thanks,Manas

Hi Manas,yes sure.But you need to have a runtime toolkit for it.http://www.codesys.com/products/codesys ... olkit.htmlBREdwin

Thanks Edwin.I have the hardware in which Linux is running.So once I get the Runtime toolkit, I need some support to enable CODESYS on my hardware.How can i get that support?Thanks & Regards,Manas

Hi,The CODESYS Runtime Toolkit includes:- a comprehensive integration manual for the implementation of the runtime System and- a workshop for developers who are responsible for the porting of the runtime systemBREdwin

Hi Edwin,One last question before I ask for Codesys License, Is there any CODESYS runtime toolkit evaluation version which i can use for Linux and Arm Cortex A8 (may be vary basic, just to prove the concept)?regards,manas

for this you need to contact our sales department.BREdwin

Hi,by the way, for Evaluation purpose you might use the raspberry pi instead:http://store.codesys.com/systeme/codesy ... pi-sl.htmlSure this runtime does not run on your AM3354 Hardware, but for evaluation what is possible, this should be suitable.The advantage on that:This is immediately available -> just download it and buy a Pi Hardware - I would recommend to use PI2BREdwin
