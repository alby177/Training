i try to install codesys control on win 10 x64 pro but i don't see the processor cores , anyone has idea how solve this problem

Hi,which processor does your System have?BREdwin

HI Edwin in have intel xeon E3-1240 v5 , now I tried with codesys win 64 it works ok, but you had to install WinPcap

Hi,ok sure this works, but Control RTE should work on this device too.You have 4 real core.BREdwin

It may need to be made additional settings (register or windows features) or install additional software ?, I do not understand why I do not see coreYou can transmits the checks should do to solve this problem?

Hi,not really -deactivate 1.hyperthreading in the BIOS2. disable Speedstep3. disable c-stateseverthing which makes the CPU clocks instable Need to be disabled. (See RTE documentation)If the Problem still exists. Give an email to Support to investigate it.BREdwin

Hi,it is a bug will be solved with 3.5SP11 Version.BREdwin

Is it possible to use hyperthreading or is it planed with future versions of ControlRTE?e.g CPU with 8 real cores and 16 threads to 7 cores with 14 threads and one core for Control RTE.Currently only 7 cores with 7 threads are available next to the core with ControlRTE.

Hi,As soon as Microsoft offers this possibility (which they will probably never do), we will implement it as well.The basic prerequisite for RTE to run on its own core is that Windows leaves it alone.And Windows can only be limited to a number of CPU cores, you can't tell which Windows to run on and which not.And the order of numbering is always the same (here a "dual core with hyperthreading" example, PC for physical core, HT for hyperthreading core):0: PC | 1: PC | 2: HT | 3: HTIf you limit Windows to the first core, the RTE could use the remaining 3 (this may come with Multicore RTE), but not Windows.It is therefore not possible to specify that Windows should run on Core 0 and 2, so that the RTE can get 1 and 3.BREdwin
