Hi,I connected an RPI3 running Codesys Control (current version) to the Ethernet port of a UR10 (Robot) in order to establish a Profinet fieldbus connection. While the Bus seems to be running (green status in Codesys and on the UR10), all the entries in the I/O mapping are greyed and have no live values. I am rather new to CodeSys, so I hope it is just a stupid mistake on my side? As you can see I have not implemented anything like POU, mappings, variable lists and so on yet - is this maybe necessary?A second question concerns the actual naming of each byte/word/bool in Codesys. UR provides two .awl files (for input and output) as well as a UDT file. Can I use those in Codesys as well? Currently each I/O is listed as byte and unnamed.Hope you can point me in the right direction!

Hi,the only thing is you need to do:Map variables and use them in the pou's!Independent which fieldbus you are using, this is mandatory to have an update cycle (unused variables are never updated due performance reason - not needed to update when they are not used)If you just want to test by setting variables manually/force them you need to change to 'Enable 2 always in buscycle Task - see screenshot.You see if the IO's are updated - if they are the variables are blue/black when you are online - if not updated light grayBREdwin
