Hi All,    I have created a very simple POU with action call in FDB. after I saved re-opened the file. I got the error like below and cannot save it anymore. However, if i use ST for ACTION, there is no issue at all. Is there anybody else encounter this issue. Thanks

Hi,i have tried to reproduce this with current Version (3.5.9.20)This does not happen with this Version (sure I have only Windows 7)BREdwin

Hi Edwin, thank you for your reply. I received email from 3S support, and told me the issue exist in 3.5.8.1 and was fixed in SP9.Once again, thank  you. Have a nice day.
