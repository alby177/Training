I have an old project for v3.5.xx where a Task is controlled by a global variable. The task type is status.This worked fine with the old version but now when I have v 3.5.SP7 patch 2 and the device Codesys Control Win V3 3.5.7.20 I get this exception when the variable turns TRUE.*EXCEPTION* [ProcessorLoadWatchdog] occurred in: App=[all], Task=[all]The code in the POU is a single ladder rung (no loops).The task controlled via status of a global variable "gets in to spin" (runs more than 20.000 times faster than freewheeling) and causes the exception. Attachment:Task_exception2.PNGOne solution is to let the task, controlled by status, reset the global variable. This turns of the task and it will be run again when the variable becomes TRUE. With this workaround I donÂ´t get the exception, but I thought this should be handled by the task-scheduler (am I wrong).Any ideas?
