CoDeSys has Gateway DDE Server component.
How it can be used by an application developed in Visual Basic or Visual C++?
Is there any documentation and sample code to develop such an interface?
Many of our PLC users develop PC based applications using Visual Basic and need a standard interface to access the data from PLC.
We can furnish them sample codes to access PLC data through Gateway DDE server.
