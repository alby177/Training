OPCGatewayClient is configured throught the OPCGateway.csv configuration file. As this is a comma separated file, it does not allow the use of any comma. This is a problem when trying to map an element of a bidimensional array like this:

element[1,1] 

These are some of  the substitutions for the comma I have tried:
** 
*** 
'.' 
"," 
;,; 
.  

Does anyone have a solution for this problem?

Thanks!

Roberto
