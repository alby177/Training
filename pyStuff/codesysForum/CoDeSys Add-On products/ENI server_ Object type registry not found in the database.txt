Well, the topic line says almost everything,

When I try to connect to the ENI server from the ENI explorer I receive this message with no more explanations at all...

Object type registry not found in the database. Please report to the server's administrator

I'm worried as I could have lost all my old programs...

What should I do in order to have the system working again?

Thank you in advance for your time and help.

PS: 
I'm using:
ENI Admin 1.1.4.0
ENI Control 1.1.2.0
ENI Explorer 1.0.0.0+

Well... if somebody has the same problem and is, like me, waiting for a solution here it comes:

You must have a user named "eni" with a password with the same letters in order to allow the software to work...

I guess this is a bug, but it seems it is specified in the manual.

Good luck and thank you for trying (of course to the ones that did).
