Hi,

I am absolutely new to OPC so if anyone could help me with this i would be very happy:

I want to write a C++ client application that monitors some variables from a project running on a softPLC (under windows xp). As far as i understood from documentation OPC is the solution for this. 
I get the OPC server running but can anyone tell me how i can communicate with the OPC server now from my client application??
Someone maybe has an example in C++?

thanks a lot in advance!
wouter

You can connect opc server to your program by using PLCHandler.
This PLCHandler can be used in c or in vb.If you want to use in vb,you can 
use .ocx file.If you want to use with c,you can use dll file.
