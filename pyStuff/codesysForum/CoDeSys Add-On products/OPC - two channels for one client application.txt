Hello

Such situation:

PLC -> Pc1 -> Pc2

PLC, Pc1 - RS232 connection
Pc1,Pc2 - TCP/IP (crossover cable)

There is  client application working on Pc2 that communicates with Gateway through TCP/IP. While loging in I choose proper configuration  and everything works fine.  

However, what if I want to run another client application on Pc2 or use two channels for one client application? Loging should be done twice - each for each channel? Is it possible? I have problems with defying second channel. Any clues?
