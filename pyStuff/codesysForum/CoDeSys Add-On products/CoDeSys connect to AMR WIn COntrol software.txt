Hi all..
actually i have something to do with CoDeSys...My PLC which is written in CODeSys (Stange PLC) need to be connected with AMR Win Control software....Before this, AMR WIn Control can only be connected to Almemo machine by ahlborn...Now i Want to connect it to my PLC....

How to establish the connection between my PLC and AMR win control software.This software is used to display the temperature in my PLC...

Any opinion and suggestion will be much appreciated...
