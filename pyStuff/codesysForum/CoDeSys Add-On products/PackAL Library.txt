Does anyone know if there is a OMAC PackAL for CoDeSys available?

I would like to know the same. I am currently creating my own. I do know that Wago has created a library framework (template).  If you are not using PLCopen then you are going to create your own control modules your self anyways. Let me know what you find.

Hi spfeif !What is the diffrence of PackML and PackAL?After reading yours request, I started to investigate what it was you were looking for.This is something I find very intresting, a standard template to make code and communication between machines and what I understand even between code/stations.I also found out that Wago have made this framework from some basic code from 3S. Mitsubishi has released code on there site.Will see if I can convince my boss to pay the membership to OMAC so I can get the P&L implementation guide./Torbj√∂rn
