Generally speaking it is not fast in XP either, but at least one can make a "Get all latest versions" without having to go to eat something in the middle.

In windows 7 it is slow to death.

Is something out there that could make it work faster?

Any configuration trick, any patch, any tool or advice?

PS: 
Versions:
ENI CONTROL v. 1.1.2.0 (2004)
ENI ADMIN 1.1.4.0 (2005)

Thank you in advance.
