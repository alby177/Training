Hello,

I'm using a Festo Codesys PLC and would like to import some data into Excel via DDE which is supported (the Codesys help says so). Do we have some examples on how this can be done?

Thanks,
-Dude

Hello,

find some samples on the 3S website

Examples/Projects/CoDeSysV2.3/Communication/DDE/

There you'll find what you are looking for.
