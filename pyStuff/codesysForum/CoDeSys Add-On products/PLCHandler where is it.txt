Hi,

I'm looking for something tools how to access into plc via VC++ application. On system Windows CE5.( PLC manufacturer is MicroInovation) 

OPC server on CoDeSys is free of charge and the best (in normal Windows), but WinCE isn't running.  Now I read in 3s site about PLCHandler (some pdf file). I look for on supply CD where is CoDeSys, Opc server, some library and target settings, and in directory \VISU is PLCHandler.DLL and PLCHandler.INI. It is too little. I don't know where is found SDK or (header file for DLL).

Hi,
the PLCHandler is not for free, please contact either the hardware vendor, or our sales team (sales@3s-software.com) for an offer.
