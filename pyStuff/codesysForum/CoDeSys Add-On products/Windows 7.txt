Are there versions of CoDeSys 2.3 that work better on Windows 7?  Some fo the issue we've incountered with installing CoDeSys 2.3.9.5 on Windows 7 include
1. Loading from shortcut (had to go into porgram files to do this)
2. Errors during install (looks like it ran fine once installed however)
3. CoDeSys HMI seemed to work fine except the input buttons on the visualization where not working.  

Thank you,
Tom

So you got it to install on Windows 7? Ours is messed up. CoDeSys doesn't recognize any of the installed targets. Did you have to do anything differently?

By the way we did finally get it to load and work. Long story short I un-installed CoDeSys and re-installed. But the reinstall I changed the Original CD install and added all my old targets so that I have one setup with an all inclusive Targets. This worked.
