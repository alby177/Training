There is a document named modbus lib description. On the 8th page it mentions that I can find a sample project named ModbusTCP_Test.pro in a library, but I can't figure out which. Can anyone help me find it?Thanks!Here is a link to the PDF:http://www.3s-software.com/se_data/_fil ... %20TCP.pdf

As the pdf says it should be in the library included.so start a new program, load the lib and check if there is a function block called modbustcpi can not find the lib on 3s so if you sent it to me the complete lib, i will send you the exported program.
