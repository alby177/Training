Has anybody managed to access the PLCHandler.dll directly? (Not the ActiveX control). To make it more interesting, I'm having to convert the headers to Pascal format.

Unfortunately the examples are very thin on the ground, the documentation largely incomplete (i.e. missing information or with a note "to be filled in later"). This isn't making it exactly easy! Is there updated or up to date information anywhere?
