I'm using PlcHandlerX version 3.0.1.6, and now I would try to connect with new device on my desktop called BOSCH REXROTH HCS02.

My OCX control accept INI configuration file that contains main parameters for connect with it in RS232 mode.

I tried with ARTI and GATEWAY mode (nologin TRUE or FALSE) but never work right.

My baudrate is 115200 as I log with serial analyzer (between BOSH and Codesys software).

May someone help me please?? What I've to insert in my INI file to connect with BOSCH?

Thanks so much,
Alex.
