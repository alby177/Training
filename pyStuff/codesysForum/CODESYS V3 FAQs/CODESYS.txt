Is it possible to convert V2.3 Project/libraries to V3?Yes, it is possible.If you open a V2.3 .pro file or a CODESYS V2.3 lib file , with CODESYS Version 3.x, the project will be imported.Attention:This is only possible with the CODESYS 32Bit Version of the development system!It is possible to have both Versions  installed on an 64Bit Windows!The OnlineHelp provides the "how to" steps:Concepts and Base Components > Import of CODESYS V2.3 ProjectsBack to FAQ overview

This message is sent by  the runtime system which have not received for 30 seconds any packet from the Gateway. So this means the Gateway does not respond anymore. A further (very seldom) possible reason is, that the communication thread on the runtime system was blocked for more or less exactly 30 seconds, and then it detects the timeout just a few 0..400 ms before the Gateway… -          Which exact versions of the Gateway and CODESYS runtime are used?-          Operating system/CPU type of the Gateway PC?-          What have to be done to handle this issue? Is it enough to login again, or have the Gateway to be restarted or…?-          Wireshark-Log?Back to FAQ overview

What ports are used in CODESYS?following ports are used:UDP for broadcasts:17401741 1742 1743for Gateway:1217If TCPBlockDrv is used to connect to the plcTCP-ports 11740-11743Back to FAQ overview

How to get a fix Target ID?If the system contains more then two networkadapters, the target ID can be different, depending which adapter is used at systemstart.To avoid this, the adapter can be specified within the Gateway.cfg file:Code:[CmpRouter]NumRouters=1MaxRouters=10.MainNet=ether1[CmpBlkDrvUdp]itf.0.ipaddress=192.168.12.123 ;enter your static ip address hereitf.0.networkmask=255.255.255.0 ;enter your static subnet mask hereitf.0.name=ether1store changed settings, restart Gateway.Back to FAQ overview

How to enable Gateway Logging?Logging can be enabled with the following settings in Gateway.cfg:Example for a 5MB Logfile:Code:[CmpLog]Logger.0.Name=StdLoggerLogger.0.Enable=1Logger.0.MaxEntries=1000Logger.0.MaxFileSize=5000000Logger.0.MaxFiles=10Logger.0.Backend.0.ClassId=0x00000104Logger.0.Backend.1.ClassId=0x0000010BBack to FAQ overview

No connection to Gateway/Plc?There are this main error messages:The Gateway is a stand alone software and is always involved as soon as you connect CODESYS with a PLC of any kind. The Gateway acts as a router for CODESYS network telegrams: CODES <-----------> Gateway <-----------> PLC1) Gateway Connection Closed This happens when an existing connection between CODESYS (=CDS) and the Gateway (=GW) has been interrupted. There are lot of possible reasons for this: - The Windows network configuration has been changed while being logged in (e.g. when a Notebook is removed from the docking station)- Changing firewall settings while being logged in- GW has been stopped- A crash of the GW 2) No connection to gatewayThis happens when a new connection between CDS and GW is started but the GW does not reply. Reasons could be the same as above 3) No Connection to device.Please rescan your network Connection between GW and PLC has been terminated. Reasons could be:- Demo time of 3S Runtime System (=RTS) has expired- Network connection has been interrupted (e.g. removing LAN cable, WLAN interrupted)- Network configuration of PC has been changed (e.g. by plugging a WLAN-USB Stick)- RTS has crashedBack to FAQ overview

How to connect a plc with VPN?Classically UDP telegrams are blocked by the IT. In this case the UDP ports 1740-1743 should be enabled for UDP broadcasts.An Option is to use the TCPBlockdriver then you need to Forward TCP Port 11740-11743Workaround if not possible: use a running Gateway on remote VPN side (either a standalone gateway or if possible an active gateway in the plc)In case of using Windows there is a standalone setup of the gateway available in case there is no Windows running it could also be a 3S plc with embedded gateway component like for example Raspberry Pi could act as gateway.Back to FAQ overview

Update your Project from previous CODESYS V3 Versions - best practice - steps needed to be done ?Example: You dowload an application example from store, but this example show on open project the information -> it was build for example 3.5SP2 andask to update compiler version and more.Which steps are needed to have a full updated project in current CODESYS version?1. after project open 'Project Environment Dialog' should be answered with 'set all to newest' (compiler and visualization profile will ne updated)2. rightclick on device tree to the plc and select 'update device' to the actual version3. rightclick on fieldbus master and after that to the slaves and select 'update device' to the actual versionafter finishing this all placeholders and library dependencies are updated and you project is in current version state.Back to FAQ overview

Question: I got a project from someone else, If we open it several libraries are reported as missing not installed - How could this be avoided Answer:The reason why this happen is:Your customer which gave you the project is using for example 3.5.3.0, but you are using 3.5.4.0 Version. (And you have only a clean 3.5.4.0 Version installed)The installation contains only the current needed library set, therefore some of the libraries which are needed by place holder of a 3.5.3.0 Version and devicedescriptions are probably missing.How to avoid this?1. Ask your customer to provide you with an projectarchive - this contains in every case every missing devicedescription and all libraries.2. There is a library repository Archive available in the CODESYS store (http://store.codesys.com/repository-archive.html) which contains the 'delta' of the libraries to the previous Version.3. The final solution have been released with CODESYS 3.5SP5: It is possible to download missing libraries on demand via librarymanager - ( downloaded from our server by CODESYS development tool)4. CODESYS 3.5SP6: It is possible to download missing devices on demand via rightclick on devices which are missing.You identify the missing devices by: ' They have this red sign with questionmark' rightclick on these offer the possibilty to download the missing devices - Attention: Both missing library download and device download does only word for 3S libs / devicesYou could add your own download Location for if you want to provide your customers with devices and libraiesBack to FAQ overview

What is needed to switch the application -> one plc type to a different plc typeThe only thing what is needed is to 'rightclick' the device then 'update device' and select the Control RTE.(sure RTE does not suppoert I2C / SPI devices) but as long as you use devices which are available on both platforms a switch without effort is possible.Example: You are using Ethercat in your Raspberry Pi application, now you decide to switch to a realtime capable plc - you need for example distributed clocks for servo drives. Then update the device to Control RTE - specify the Ethercat adapter - login. That was it!Back to FAQ overview

How do we develop libraries in CODESYS V3.1. Goto Tools->Options->Features -> Predefined Feature sets - switch to professional feature set (since 3.5SP8 not needed anymore)Then the most important is for working with libraries:Use two instances of the CODESYS development system, the one which opens your library and the second instance open the project whichexecute your library code to test.If you safe the library by 'Safe project and install into library repository' button,in the second instance you see that the library is updated.You could set brakepoints and debug in the project (even set brakepoints in the library code is possible)Attention:Keep in mind, that if you deliver libraries to your customer you should generate 'compiled-library' and distribute them in this format, except you want your user see the source and give them the debug possibility then distribute your lib as .libraryDebug libraries:If you work with your developed library you could step into the library by setting a brakepoint into the library fb's/functions (librarymanager - browse to the fb and set a brakepoint there - this you do in the CODESYS instance where the test project is opened)For additional technical information on libraries read the following important help chapter in the online help: "c:\Program Files (x86)\3S CODESYS\CODESYS\Online Help\en\LibDevSummary.chm"Back to FAQ overview

Requirement: you need to buy a license in the CODESYS store then you will get a ticketnumber via emailThe Licensing procedure is the following:Licensing via the CODESYS Development SystemRequirements:PC with CODESYS Development System, internet access and connected Raspberry Pi.Licensing is done via PC / notebook with the CODESYS Development System and the connected Raspberry Pi. 1. Scan your Raspberry Pi in the network and connect to it.2. The license entries are edited via double-click on the device under “PLC settings” / “Edit licenses…”.  The license activation is done under “Install licenses” / “Activate license” by entering the ticket number and transfer of the license to the CODESYS Software Key (Softcontainer).Back to FAQ overview

Why is this needed?Because in case of an corrupt SD card image you need the possibility to restore the license (after new install if Raspberry Pi)Different processes (e.g. loss of power) can lead to a corruption of the file system of the Raspberry Pi. To back up the license the following proceeding is recommended:Backup of the license1.	Activation of the license (as described above)2.	Reboot of the Raspberry Pi3.	Backup of the license file on an external storage deviceTo safe the license file:  3SLicenseInfo.tar which you will find in the 'backup' directory on the Raspberry Pi (accessible in CODESYS File Browser via double-click on the device under the tab “Files”). Store the content of the folder („3SLicenseInfo.tar“) to your computers harddiskAttention: this backupfile should have a file size of around 130kb-140kb in case of a valid backup!!Back to FAQ overview Attention new:Backup of the license by CMLicenseNew.WibuCmRaU File. (easyier Backup method)

To reactivate the license the license file archive has to be copied to the folder “restore”. Subsequently the system has to be rebooted.Note: On activation the license is bound to a single Raspberry Pi and can only be reactivated on the same device!A license transfer is not supported to another Pi than the original licensed.Attention New:Restore by license update file:  CMLicenseNew.WibuCmRaU If you have missed to save this file, this could be requested (send the origin ticket number via CODESYS Store - 'my question' - Login to your store account)Back to FAQ overview

In case of being behind a proxy-server, the activation of the license could fail, if the proxy-server is not properly configured.But where should we configure the proxy.This is in CODESYS (3.5SP5 is needed) under Tools - Options - Proxy Settings.Back to FAQ overview

Why do you get on some projects examples from store after open them the message 'missing libraries'?The examples are uploaded to a specific version and are usually not updated to every new release of CODESYS,So it might be that your CODESYS Version is newer then the plc device version which is used in the project example. (the placeholders for the libraries are in the devicedescription of the plc)How to solve this?Which steps are needed to have a full updated project in current CODESYS version?1. after project open 'Project Environment Dialog' should be answered with 'set all to newest' (compiler and visualization profile will ne updated)2. rightclick on device tree to the plc and select 'update device' to the current version3. rightclick on fieldbus master (if there are on used in the example project) and after that to the slaves and select 'update device' to the current versionafter finishing this all placeholders and library dependencies are updated and you project is in current version state.

there are several ways to do that:prefered method:1. Update by Update Raspberry Pi Command see screenshot a) scan the pi b) select the Pi by IPAdress c) update the pimore advanced usually not needed:2. manually by Debian Package - Update by CODESYS Developmentsystem(see screenshot):copy the Debian package from the store download (codesyscontrol_arm_raspberry_V3.5.x.x.deb ) to the pivia CODESYS file bowser.Then connect via ssh (putty) to the pi.Execute: sudo -scd /root/dpkg -i codesyscontrol_arm_raspberry_V3.5.x.x.deb2. an other option is: copy it to the sd card image:if you plug the sd card Image to the windows pc you could access the boot partition of the picopy the codesyscontrol_arm_raspberry_V3.5.x.x.deb to this Partition.Boot the pi then connect via ssh (putty) to the pi.Execute:sudo -scd /boot/dpkg -i codesyscontrol_arm_raspberry_V3.5.x.x.debrm codesyscontrol_arm_raspberry_V3.5.x.x.deb

Why is this needed?Because in case of an reinstalling the Firmware you need the possibility to restore the licenseTo back up the license the following proceeding is recommended:Backup of the license1. Activation of the license (as described above)2. Reboot of the PFC2003. Backup of the license file on an external storage deviceTo safe the license file: 3SLicenseInfo.tar which you will find in the 'backup' directory on the PFC (accessible in CODESYS File Browser via double-click on the device under the tab “Files”).Store the content of the folder („3SLicenseInfo.tar“) to your computers harddiskAttention: this backupfile should have a file size of around 130kb-140kb in case of a valid backup!!Attention new:2. option to backup the license my license update filesave the File CMLiecenseNew.WibuCmRaU, which you find here in the plc file browser to your pc.

To reactivate the license the license file archive has to be copied to the folder “restore”. Subsequently the system has to be rebooted.Note: On activation the license is bound to a single PFC200 and can only be reactivated on the same device/hardware!A license transfer is not supported to another PFC than the original licensed.Attention New:Restore by license update file: CMLicenseNew.WibuCmRaU If you have missed to save this file, this could be requested (send the origin ticket number via CODESYS Store - 'my question' - Login to your store account)If this does not work:delete the directory: /var/opt/codesys/cmact_licenses/this could be done by the CODESYS file borwserand retry to apply the license by the backup file.

Requirement: you need to buy a license in the CODESYS store then you will get a ticketnumber via emailThe Licensing procedure is the following:Licensing via the CODESYS Development SystemRequirements:PC with CODESYS Development System, internet access and connected PFC200.Licensing is done via PC / notebook with the CODESYS Development System and the connected PFC. 1. Scan your PFC200 in the network and connect to it.2. The license entries are edited via double-click on the device under “PLC settings” / “Edit licenses…”. The license activation is done under “Install licenses” / “Activate license” by entering the ticket number and transfer of the license to the CODESYS Software Key (Softcontainer).Attention: A license backup for each activated PFC Controller is highly recommended/mandatoryFor changing the firmware in the PFC Controller you need the backup file to restore the license.Tickets could only activated once!Prefered method: Backup CMLicenseNew.WibuCmRaU  file to your pc or use the tar file. (both is possible)The backupfile should have a file size of around 130kb-140kb in case of a valid backup!

How to check if the PFC is licensed or not from IEC Code.

you need to change the CODESYS Control Win under Windows Services to Startup type: Automatic

If you work with an own created SD Images including all your Installation and CODESYS runtime so the procedure is: 1.	Master Image from original PI – is lincensed or unlicensed no matter2.	Generate an SD Image of it3.	on 2. Pi  – after 1. Bootup delete the content of /root/cmactlicense/ or since 3.5SP12  /var/opt/codesys/cmact_licenses/4.	restart plc by reboot     a.	or better sudo /et/init.d/codesyscontrol stop    b.	or better sudo /et/init.d/codesyscontrol startNow an empty SoftContainer for the new device (you new Pi has a different Serial number) is available 5.	now license the this PIRecommendation:Backup now the file CMLicenseNew.WibuCMRaU this is your update file for the PI – could use this to restore the license at any time to this PI where you pull out this file.(Use CODESYS File browser for doing this)
