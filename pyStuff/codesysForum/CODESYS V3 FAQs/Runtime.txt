RTE stops under Windows 7 / Windows 8Problem: RTE stops after a certain timeSolution: Open Task Scheduler and disable the Power Efficiency DiagnosticDisable by cmdline:schtasks /change /TN "\Microsoft\Windows\Power Efficiency Diagnostics\AnalyzeSystem" /DISABLEAttachment:3.jpgBack to FAQ overview

How could we check if the realtime capabilities are ok with the bios Setting on my Windows platform?1. After setting the bios according to the CoDeSysControlRTEV3_Manual.pdf (throtteling / speedstep / C-states  must be switched off)you need to check if your processor clock is stable.A good tool to verify it / measure it is CPUZ (Google it).Attention you should only execute either CPUZ or Control RTE not both at the same time (RTE will stop if you do it!)2. Then Login to Control RTE with the project - check the taskmonitor - reset the jitter values (rightclick) then you should see values on the last row yellow marked like in the attached screenshotGenerate high log on the RTE pc by opening IE / other applications and check if this has influence on the jitter valuesBack to FAQ overview

Question: Is it possible to shutdown the pc on which the RTE is running on, triggerd by the codesys applicationAnswer:yes, there are two possibilities:1. triggered by targetvisu:% execute Command  c:\WINDOWS\system32\shutdown.exe -s -t 00 -f', â€¦ siehe Screenshot2. by iec code use SysProcessCreate (you need to add sysprocess.library)SysProcessCreate(pszApplication:= 'c:\windows\system32\shutdown.exe', pszCommandLine:= '/p /f ', ulHide:= 0, pResult:= udiTemp);Back to FAQ overview

Question: What is needed to support persistent / retain dataAnswer:In general the plc should have a build in nvram or should be connected to an UPS (uninterrupted power supply)Back to FAQ overview

Question: What is the advanatge / disadvantage on using NVRAM - UPS(uninterruptable power supply ) The technical difference is:NVRAM is a mapped area in which on each cycle the retain variable are updated In case of using a UPS - this is the ram area and on shutdown of the runtime the runtime write the retain files (restore them on startup)The result on this:With nvram you have only a limited amount of retains for example 128k if the retain memory has this size.With UPS there is not limit in size (sure your ram but this is nowadays not really a limit)nvram: The cpu load (cycle time grow) could grow with increasing nvram occupancy, since this will lead to cyclic read and write access to this memory, for each used variable one access.(Hint if you are using many retain variable with nvram: Declare a structure which mirrors the retains data and copy the whole struct in the cycle, this is then only one access as oposed to many memory access if you have a bunch of single retain variables - this you should see immediately in the cycle time load)Back to FAQ overview

Is it possible to use my Notebook to have Control RTE and Ethercat running on it (Testing purpose)?Yes this is possible if you use a Realtek RTL8111B / RTL8111D compatible ExpressCardFor Example: Exys 1GB Ethernet LAN ExpressCard EX-6087.Take care on the bios settings / disable speedstep, c-states etc like in the RTE documentation is mentioned, to have a stable processor clockin case you need hard realtime capabilities.Back to FAQ overview

Does Control RTE run on 64Bit Windows ?Yes since 3.5SP5 Release there is a Setup available for 64Bit Control RTE.Capable for Ethercat / SoftMotion / Visualization/Profinet / Modbus / Ethernet IP / CANopen [Back to FAQ overview
