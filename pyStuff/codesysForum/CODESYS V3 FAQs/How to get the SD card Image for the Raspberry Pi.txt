Since 3.5SP7 release the sd card image is not available in the store download, it is needed to download from RaspberryPi.org.Due the fact that we only add the plc Debian package therefore a customization of the Debian Image is not needed anymore.We have an additional update mechanism which should make it more simple to bring the plc runtime to the pi or update an existing Image.Please use the latest Image from Raspberry Pi.org here:https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/direct link to get SD Image filehttp://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspbian_latest 'Flash' the image to the sd card by using:https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentati ... /README.md(For example under Windows you will use: Win32DiskImager)Then start your Pi with this Image.Attention: read this article here you need to enable ssh login.https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/page/2 ... bian-Pixelssh is by default disabled in newer Debian Versions - you need to enable it.Next steps in the CODESYS Development system:Install the "CODESYS Control for Raspberry PI_2.2.0.x.package" by the CODESYS Package Manager,After doing this successfully you need to restart CODESYS!After the restart of CODESYS you should have an additional Menu Command in CODESYS ‘Update Raspberry PI’ Using this Update Raspberry Pi, you could scan your available Raspberry Pi’s in your network.Select the one which you want to install by CODESYS and give the password (‘raspeberry’ for the standard Image)

How to activate the Raspberry Pi License on an runtime key?Which steps are needed to activate the license?The Ticket/license which you buy from store.codesys.com could be activated either as softlicense or as license on the runtime key (http://store.codesys.com/accessories/co ... mpakt.html)1. For the activation process you need to plug the USB Runtime Key to your CODESYS PC (not to the Pi for the activation!)2. activate the license either by the LicenseManager in CODESYS (Tools-LicenseManager) or by your browser by license.codesys.comStep 3 is not needed anymore since the Pi Runtime 3.5.9.10 release. Using the KEY as HID device is possible/recommended.After doing These steps plug the key to the Raspberry PI, now it should be licensed.3. Important: Change the Runtime Key to be reconized as memonry device - this is only Need for using it on the Raspberry Pi. (See the online help in codemeter search for: HID The steps for doing this is: (let us asume the number of the runtime key is: 2-13339888)a) Open 'CodeMeter Command Prompt'b) cmu32 /s 2-13339888 --set-config-disk MsdCommunication )
